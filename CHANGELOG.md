# Changelog

All notable public changes to `paper-fetch-skill` are documented in this file.

## Unreleased

<!-- SCAFFOLD: changelog-unreleased -->

## 6.2.0 - 2026-09-07

### Added — CLI progress and cooperative cancellation

- Single and batch fetches now support `--progress auto|text|jsonl|none` on stderr, preserving stdout for paper content or JSON. The default `auto` displays text only in a terminal; JSONL reports input-indexed stages, asset counts, and terminal manifest records.
- `--progress jsonl --control-stdin` accepts commands to cancel one input or the entire batch. Cancellation preserves completed results and original input order; duplicate DOI inputs retain shared work until all dependent inputs are cancelled. Terminal events follow output submission and worker cleanup, while final batch JSONL remains a single input-ordered result file.

### Fixed — Oxford Academic inline images

- Oxford Academic HTML now rewrites downloaded preview-image links to local asset paths before article-model conversion, keeping figures inline without duplicate images. Undownloaded images retain their remote links, and partial failures retain their acceptance evidence.

### Changed — paper skill discovery and reading guidance

- Skill descriptions now cover full-text retrieval and availability probes, including explicit paper candidates found by an agent searching for evidence to answer a question. The existing five presets now state their selection criteria.
- Batch guidance applies the 50-input limit before identity resolution, preserves original indices, and deduplicates canonical DOIs across chunks. Full reading and comparison tasks reuse qualified local text or fetch each paper with the existing reading preset; compact results and truncated bounded excerpts do not count as having read the full text.
- Availability-only tasks report per-item probe evidence, errors, and unscheduled states without requiring full-text acceptance or automatically fetching the paper. Fetch/cache examples explicitly select supported reference parameters; existing authorization, cache scope, output, and provenance boundaries remain unchanged.

## 6.1.6 - 2026-09-07

### Fixed — Nature extended assets and Wiley image retrieval

- Nature Extended Data tables and figures now belong to supplementary scope: `body` excludes them, while `all` retrieves them through the existing image download path. Table matching no longer assumes that the displayed table number equals the page URL number; legacy table images require matching page labels, article backlinks, image DOI, and table content context. Image tables retain their Markdown references, and missing extended assets retain provenance and structured failure evidence for acceptance.
- Wiley formula bitmaps now accept positive natural dimensions and require an exact match to the requested image URL, avoiding substitution with unrelated page images. Formula and figure image navigation waits for navigation commit and image readiness instead of image-document `DOMContentLoaded`.
- Wiley figures now prefer the publisher's full-size candidates and require the loaded image URL to match the current target during page export and image navigation. Preview fallback retains its source, dimensions, and full-size failure evidence, with `download_tier=preview` and `preview_accepted=false` so unified acceptance reports the quality downgrade.

## 6.1.5 - 2026-09-05

### Breaking — unified MCP probe entry point

- Removed the standalone `has_fulltext` MCP tool without an alias, reducing the tool count from ten to nine. Use `batch_check(queries=[query])` for a single paper and read `probe_state`, evidence, warnings, and item errors from `results[0]`; ambiguous candidates now live in the item error instead of the former single-tool top-level error.
- `batch_check` now accepts only `mode="metadata"`, which remains the default. Removed its article-fetch path while preserving schema-v2 metadata fields, input order, canonical-DOI deduplication, isolated item contexts, shared transport, provider-lane limits, cancellation, and progress. The Python `probe_has_fulltext` service and provider-catalog resource remain unchanged.
- Replace article checks with `batch_fetch` and judge each result by `acceptance`. For body checks without disk output, explicitly use `modes=["article"]`, `detail="compact"`, `save_markdown=false`, `no_download=true`, `prefer_cache=false`, `artifact_mode="none"`, and `strategy={"asset_profile":"none"}`, without `batch_results`. Existing `batch_fetch` defaults are unchanged.

### Changed — skill workflow guidance

- Determine task intent and request parameters before local/cache checks; temporary reading does not require selecting a cache directory. Preserve the five presets and reuse explicit user choices and existing authorization without repeated confirmation.
- Make reference reading and acceptance reporting depend on the task, clarify runtime preparation and access boundaries, and continue the requested summary, comparison, translation, or extraction after obtaining verified text.

## 6.1.4 - 2026-09-05

### Fixed — publisher browser and asset retrieval

- AIP now uses the normal HTML attempt without media interception or the Adzerk/Crossmark empty-script responses, preserving its existing non-persistent session and article readiness checks.
- IEEE original-image recovery now follows the matching article link in the shared browser session. Figures use the publisher viewer; table-image links open a temporary browser tab. Recovery validates the original response bytes and retains per-asset failure reporting and preview fallback.
- Springer/Nature now downloads known original-image candidates before requesting figure pages. Figure-page discovery runs only when needed, within the same asset resolution and budget; table-page completion and preview provenance remain intact.
- Science now associates the final page with the latest completed main-frame navigation response for the current candidate, matching URL and DOI. An initial denied response no longer overrides a subsequently loaded article; iframe and unrelated responses cannot replace the article status.
- PNAS now blocks only the exact sidebar metrics endpoint and reports `blocked_sidebar_metrics_count`. Three cold-session comparisons did not demonstrate a consistent speedup; browser page processing remains a performance limitation. The documented PMC browser-free experiment is not an implemented retrieval route.

## 6.1.3 - 2026-09-04

### Changed — provider and browser ownership

- Article provenance now resolves from each catalog route's declared source, with exact route-name selection and a compatibility path for PDF recovery payloads that only identify the route kind. Existing generic ACS, Science, and PNAS sources and the shared Wiley browser source remain unchanged.
- Browser landing-page, provider, and asset URL checks now reuse the catalog hostname matcher while preserving the distinct provider-domain, route-host, candidate-construction, and exact MDPI/Frontiers network boundaries.
- Removed the AMS and MDPI HTML compatibility facades, the Springer-only reference re-export, fifteen unconsumed private browser-workflow root exports, the legacy Playwright-named PDF alias, and two unused fast-browser wrappers. The remaining Springer facade is now a static compatibility export and no longer mutates canonical extraction modules when called.
- Removed the unused eager `browser_runtime.save_storage_state` facade and its backend/path forwarding chain. Browser fetch and preflight continue to stage provider-scoped state and atomically commit it only after acceptance.

### Changed — schema and repository maintenance

- MCP request schemas now share one exact optional-string normalization helper across fetch, batch, cache, and browser-preflight path fields; path values still trim only leading and trailing whitespace. Removed an equivalent no-op article-source rendering branch.
- Removed 240 tracked one-off live investigation artifacts. Maintainer live verification now writes to the ignored `failures/` scope; only JUnit and `live-acceptance.json` need long-term external retention, with `asset-hashes.json` added for the IEEE protected-asset run.

## 6.1.2 - 2026-09-03

### Fixed — asset completeness and provider pagination

- Standard provider fetches no longer impose a default 128-file asset cap; the per-file, aggregate-byte, pixel, and worker limits remain in force, and arXiv source archives retain their independent 128-regular-member traversal guard. Explicit finite file budgets are still enforced, fatal budget stops now return a timed failure for every admitted unfinished asset, and ordinary streamed figures no longer reserve a conversion output slot unless their payload is actually EPS or TIFF.
- IEEE reference retrieval now continues beyond 20 pages, stopping at the advertised count or on an empty, short, or duplicate page while respecting one wall-clock deadline. Landing pages that advertise references without a count now fetch them as well.
- Taylor & Francis dynamic CSV and embedded tables are hydrated in batches of 24 until all discovered tables are processed or the page deadline expires. Deadline truncation now reports the unfinished table count, and offline replay restores all bounded same-page table payloads.
- Async MCP fetches close each Camoufox manager on its owner worker thread on success, provider failure, and cooperative cancellation.
- Article rendering now recognizes metadata titles containing HTML emphasis as equivalent to Markdown-emphasized leading headings, preventing duplicate article titles.
- Offline package verification now uses the supported `paper-fetch fetch` subcommand for its DOI smoke test.

## 6.1.1 - 2026-09-02

### Fixed — ACS assets and AIP browser stability

- ACS HTML extraction now restores publisher figure-download links from the raw Silverchair body before asset discovery and deduplicates the resulting assets by identity, preserving access to the official image rendition when the cleaned article body omits those links.
- AIP browser attempts now neutralize the exact Adzerk and Crossmark widget script URLs with empty JavaScript responses. Other URLs and resource types continue normally, and a failed fulfill safely falls through, preventing intermittent third-party TLS stalls from blocking article readiness or producing insufficient-body results.

## 6.1.0 - 2026-09-02

### Fixed — audit consistency

- Batch MCP fetches now normalize optional string fields exactly like single fetches, including treating whitespace-only shared Markdown filenames as unspecified and recording the normalized request in manifests.
- Async inline-image fetches retain the existing internal article field in cache only when needed to reproduce requested images; old insufficient sidecars safely miss, while public structured content still hides unrequested articles.
- Provider results now propagate content updates made by asset hooks through article construction, workflow persistence, acquisition, and the returned provider content.
- Removed the unused KaTeX runtime dependency and installation check; the packaged Node workspace now contains only the MathML-to-LaTeX converter and its transitive dependencies while retaining KaTeX-compatible normalization goals.
- Aligned CLI, MCP, browser, cache, provider, deployment, macOS, and extraction documentation with the capabilities and contracts that remain implemented.

### Breaking — command, MCP, batch, and manifest surfaces

- The CLI is now command-only: use `paper-fetch fetch ...`. The legacy root-level fetch flags, CLI `--no-download`, durable `--run-manifest` / `--resume`, and the `manifest audit|reconcile` commands were removed. Use `--artifact-mode none` when provider artifacts and assets should not be retained.
- CLI and MCP batches may write one final `batch-results.jsonl`; it is assembled in input order and committed atomically only after every input reaches a terminal state. Append-only attempts, run summaries, audit/reconcile, and resume semantics were removed, while in-batch canonical-DOI fan-out remains. Existing differing result files still require explicit `--overwrite` / `overwrite=true`.
- Schema-v2 manifest records now expose only the current `record_status`, `acceptance`, and `output_artifacts` contract. The legacy top-level `status`, `output_path`, and `saved_markdown_path` projection and legacy acceptance/cache migration shims were removed; old, unknown, or incomplete records now fail closed instead of being guessed or upgraded.
- Removed the `summarize_paper` and `verify_citation_list` MCP prompt templates. The fetch, resolve, check, and cache tools, static provider-catalog resource, and schema-v2 payload contract remain unchanged.

### Changed — browser and transport runtime

- Camoufox is now the single browser backend. Removed the backend selector, generic Chrome/CDP runtime path, automatic browser installation/repair/update, and the CLI/MCP/environment `browser_auto_prepare` controls. Fetch, auth, and preflight only use an already prepared runtime; run `python -m camoufox fetch` explicitly when setup is needed.
- Browser preflight no longer publishes short-lived HTML or route hints for a later fetch. Every fetch performs its own navigation and repeats identity, access-boundary, body, and asset acceptance; storage state remains the intentional reusable browser capability.
- Removed the `download_dir`-backed HTTP text cache, conditional disk revalidation, cache-stat/timing collectors, and their environment controls. HTTP GET reuse is now bounded to the current process, while request safety, redirect checks, retry policy, and asset limits remain enforced.

### Changed — MCP cache access

- Removed dynamic cache index/entry resources, cache resource-list notifications, and `batch_fetch` cache `resource_uri` fields. Cache access now uses `list_cached` / `get_cached` within an explicit `download_dir` scope; the static provider catalog resource remains available.
- Removed cache `refresh` / `rescan` modes and loose-file discovery. Sidecars, Markdown, and assets are registered incrementally when written; reads trust only the current scoped index plus current DOI, capability-scope, stat, and hash evidence, without silently migrating an old or damaged index.

### Changed — provider and library contracts

- Built-in providers now load from one fixed, validated bundle list. Dynamic registration, import-order precedence, overlapping identity priorities, route-union compilation, and the generated provider catalog/route governance layer were removed; runtime network policy is compiled from an exact declared route.
- Removed compatibility-only positional constructors, broad keyword adapters, legacy urllib asset request injection, generic browser/PDF launch arguments, cross-request singleflight, and other private wrapper imports. Current typed request/options objects and one-batch DOI deduplication remain the supported paths.

### Changed — maintainer tooling and verification

- Replaced the manifest/review/scaffold onboarding tree with the smaller `docs/adding-a-provider.md` workflow: define a runtime bundle, add provider-local tests, and add representative golden replay evidence. Removed provider governance/drift/canary generators, recursive onboarding automation, Markdown-review sidecars, live benchmark tooling, and generated route documentation.
- Removed the repository coverage-focus and complexity-budget gates and the packaged `paper_fetch_devtools` quality layer. Deterministic unit, integration, provider replay, package, platform, and live-test entry points remain in their respective scopes.
- Moved static Skill integrity verification from the runtime package to `scripts/skill_integrity.py`. Offline builders/installers verify the bundled and installed host copies directly; `doctor` now reports runtime/provider health only and no longer accepts `--install-root` or emits installation-provenance status.

### Changed — release and dependency CI

- Removed the mutable `dependency-latest` rolling release, its dedicated token path, and cross-revision release-tooling overlays. Stable `v*` releases continue to publish the nine offline installers with `SHA256SUMS`, frozen dependency evidence, SBOMs, secret scanning, and provenance attestation.
- Removed the non-gating provider canary state machine; explicit legally authorized checks remain available under `tests/live`.
- Locked dependency audits now export all extras and fail directly on every `pip-audit` finding, without an empty waiver framework.
- Python 3.11 and 3.14 boundary jobs now build one wheel per Python version and smoke both isolated core and full installs.
- Python distribution verification now checks archive safety, required package/Skill payloads, metadata, entry points, and complete wheel `RECORD` coverage without maintaining a checked-in exact source inventory. The legacy repository-root Windows PowerShell bundle installer was removed; the supported Windows release artifact remains the native setup executable.

## 6.0.4 - 2026-08-29

### Fixed — release quality gates

- Extracted XML tail whitespace handling from the shared inline renderer, preserving the 6.0.3 behavior while bringing the renderer back within the repository complexity budget. Applied canonical formatting to the JATS regression tests.
- Regenerated the machine-readable provider catalog for 6.0.4 so its tool-version snapshot matches project metadata and provider governance remains synchronized.

## 6.0.3 - 2026-08-29

### Fixed — XML inline whitespace rendering

- The shared Elsevier/JATS inline renderer now collapses publisher XML source-formatting whitespace before assembling Markdown. Line wrapping around operators and emphasis no longer produces malformed emphasis or unintended block parsing, while explicit break elements and the existing split-italic subscript repair keep their established behavior.
- JATS paragraphs containing embedded blocks apply the same whitespace rule. Regression coverage includes the reported Elsevier `=` and `<` cases plus real Frontiers and Copernicus XML; PLOS shares the corrected JATS conversion path.

## 6.0.2 - 2026-08-29

### Fixed — Frontiers original figures and rolling releases

- Frontiers body figures and formula images now discover and prefer the publisher's exact original `xml-images` URLs from the canonical landing page. Graphic-stem matching keeps downloaded full-size assets and rendered Markdown aligned while avoiding incorrect article-directory URLs derived from DOI suffixes.
- The rolling dependency release `publish` job now checks out the triggering workflow commit before invoking repository release scripts. The checkout is pinned, shallow, and credential-free, preventing `prepare_release_assets.py` from failing with `Errno 2`; a structured workflow contract protects the ordering and trust boundary.

## 6.0.1 - 2026-08-28

### Fixed — release publication

- Stable publication now relies on the already verified remote tag instead of redundantly passing its commit as `target_commitish`, avoiding GitHub's workflow-permission rejection when the default branch advances while an immutable-tag release is building.
- Applied the canonical formatter, synchronized the extraction-rule validator invocation after removal of its no-op `--ci` mode, and removed the local problem audit from tracked release source.

## 6.0.0 - 2026-08-28

### Changed — explicit capabilities and smaller public surfaces

- Provider routes are now the sole capability source. Provider-level browser flags, automatic route synthesis, source-tree discovery, and dynamic registry monkeypatching were removed; built-in providers use one explicit lazy module list.
- MCP tools keep their existing `CallToolResult.structured_content` success and error payloads, but `tools/list` no longer publishes `outputSchema`. Browser capability and preflight status are derived from runtime owners, and unknown preflight states now fail closed.
- Removed private compatibility entry points, including `RawFulltextPayload.metadata`, `build_provider_registry`, unused provider wrappers, and the unconnected direct-HTTP/browser link helpers. These removals are intentionally not fronted by deprecation facades.

### Changed — repository tooling and releases

- Removed recursive onboarding agent orchestration, private DAG/state/retry machinery, evidence sidecars, geography-only live/report tooling, and production-wheel Markdown review/quality diagnostics. Deterministic review bootstrap/finalization and golden fixture manifests remain the repository-owned workflow.
- Stable releases now publish exactly nine installers plus `SHA256SUMS`. Rolling prereleases publish those installers, `dependency-manifest.json`, and `SHA256SUMS`; wheel, sdist, inventory, SBOM, and per-target evidence remain build-time verification inputs.
- Replaced the historical macOS ledger with a compact support, safety, and evidence contract derived from project metadata, workflows, the installer manifest, and the release asset owner.

See [docs/migration-v6.md](docs/migration-v6.md) for incompatible import and protocol changes.

## 5.6.1 - 2026-08-27

### Fixed — Windows release lifecycle

- Fixed the native Windows release failure caused by Inno Setup's two-phase uninstaller: the first process could return while its TEMP-hosted second phase still owned `unins000.exe`, so the overwrite upgrade created `unins001.exe` and the final residue check raced that delayed cleanup.
- Replaced the installer-side registry/command-line parsing with the official UninsIS 1.7.0 helper pinned by release, DLL, and license digests. The Windows builder verifies those files before Inno compilation and records the setup-time component in the offline manifest, dependency evidence, and CycloneDX SBOM. Upgrade now fails closed until the old uninstaller has completed and deleted its original executable, while preserving `offline.env` and other user-owned content; the LGPL license and provenance notice ship with the installer.
- Strengthened the native lifecycle gate to require exactly one post-upgrade `unins000.exe`, then wait up to 60 seconds for both the Inno success log marker and every `unins*.exe/.dat/.msg` file to disappear before applying the exact uninstall residue allowlist.

## 5.6.0 - 2026-08-27

### Fixed — skill integrity, reproducible tests, and complexity debt

- Made the static skill bundle content-addressed with a stable aggregate SHA-256/version over its exact sorted regular-file inventory. Source, staging, offline manifests, and installed host copies now reject missing, extra, changed, symlink, and special entries with the same verifier; the canonical `agents/openai.yaml` ships as source instead of being regenerated into permanent drift.
- Added a strictly read-only `--check` mode to the shared Codex/Claude/Antigravity installer, including correct Codex user/project scope lookup. Source and offline `doctor` diagnostics now compare the repository/bundled skill with the active Codex copy, expose expected/actual content versions, and fail the overall readiness result on missing or drifted active skills.
- Standardized ordinary test commands on `PYTHONPATH=src uv run python -m pytest ...` across repository guidance, generated onboarding, and CI. Pytest now fails before collection with an actionable frozen-`uv` repair command when the ambient MCP major or required trafilatura API behavior is incompatible; Python boundary controllers install that complete test contract while fresh isolated venvs still prove core and full wheels independently.
- Removed all 24 complexity regressions without widening thresholds, ignores, or suppressions by grouping existing request/runtime state and extracting behavior-preserving browser, PDF, asset, HTTP-stream, cache, and MCP batch helpers. The historical over-budget inventory falls monotonically from 55 to 47 symbols, including Playwright C901 from 44 to 40.

### Fixed — verified build and release supply chain

- Split Python wheel/sdist construction into a reusable, immutable-SHA-only `package.yml` that retains exact inventory verification, independent wheel/sdist install smokes, secret scanning, and artifact upload. Ordinary CI still runs the complete unit/coverage/quality/integration/golden/platform gates and Dependency refresh still runs the full unit suite, while Stable release now builds only release artifacts: Python packaging runs in parallel with the nine-target frozen dependency resolver, then offline installer verification, Windows lifecycle, SBOM, checksums, attestation, and publication all consume the same tagged SHA. Release neither runs nor waits for remote unit/ordinary CI; the full local unit command remains the release-operator gate before the next version and immutable tag.
- Made every workflow artifact scan explicitly select the credentials injected into that scan step. This preserves raw and URL-encoded checks for real workflow tokens while excluding unrelated hosted-runner defaults such as `PGPASSWORD`, which could otherwise falsely match ordinary bytes inside third-party Windows wheels.
- Extracted the complete quality matrix into one reusable verify workflow consumed by ordinary CI and stable releases. Stable tags are peeled to an immutable commit (including annotated tags); verification, dependency resolution, offline builds, release checkout, attestation, and the GitHub Release target all use that exact SHA, with a final tag-drift check before publication.
- Made stable releases resolve and merge frozen dependency snapshots for all nine Linux CPython 3.11–3.14, macOS arm64 CPython 3.11–3.14, and Windows CPython 3.13 targets in the same run before invoking the offline workflow with frozen dependencies enabled.
- Added per-target evidence derived from the actual staging tree: installed Python distributions and content digests, Node/Playwright packages, Camoufox delivery state, formula/image/native files, and embedded runtime provenance. Each offline artifact now carries and uploads an actual dependency manifest plus a validated CycloneDX 1.6 SBOM; release no longer substitutes a lock export for staged evidence.
- Bound native and release offline builders to the locked repository virtual environment (`.venv/bin/python` on POSIX and `.venv/Scripts/python.exe` on Windows), so the CycloneDX evidence generator always runs with the verified development toolchain instead of depending on runner-global packages.
- Pinned the Windows CPython 3.13.13 x64 embeddable archive to its official python.org URL and SHA-256 in the installer manifest and platform contract, verifies it before extraction, and records expected/actual digests in the offline manifest and SBOM.
- Added a full-archive exact wheel/sdist inventory. It structurally normalizes the one legal distribution root/`dist-info`/`egg-info`, requires exact metadata and wheel `RECORD` coverage, and rejects every unknown top-level, `.data`, package, source, or metadata member. Both artifacts install in separate venvs and run CLI, import, MCP, resource, and installed-skill smokes.
- Stable publication now validates the exact 31 pre-checksum assets (two Python distributions, their inventory, nine offline installers, eighteen target evidence files, and the merged dependency manifest), rejects missing/extra/basename collisions, copies them into a flat exclusive namespace, and writes basename-only `SHA256SUMS`. Asset and checksum files are fsynced; directory fsync is best-effort on platforms such as Windows that do not expose POSIX directory descriptors. Rolling releases reuse the same offline asset-set checker.
- Adopted the refreshed compatible dependency graph, including MCP 2.1.1, imagesize 2.0.1, and PyMuPDF4LLM 1.28.2. Tool payload tests now validate the advertised Draft 2020-12 JSON Schema instead of an SDK-internal generated model, cache authorization tests preserve fail-closed behavior across SDK exception wrapping or propagation, synthetic PNG fixtures carry the required IHDR fields, and the exact PDF golden snapshots track the current structured extraction. All declared Python, formula Node, and release resolver dependencies use rolling compatibility ranges rather than exact package pins; lockfiles retain the reproducible resolved graph.
- Added a native, serial final-Windows-EXE lifecycle gate: silent install, installed doctor/provider/formula/browser smokes, in-place overwrite upgrade, user-data preservation, silent uninstall, and an exact recursive residue allowlist. Only `offline.env`, `downloads/`, and `downloads/user-owned.txt` may remain; known or future managed files fail the gate. The immutable Windows tooling overlay now moves the builder, evidence/lifecycle scripts, helper, installer manifest, and Inno definition as one revision-pinned set.

### Security — network, credential, and logging boundaries

- Restored hostname-based shared urllib3 pools while retaining the established `SafeRemoteUrlPolicy` baseline at every redirect hop: HTTP(S), ports 80/443, public DNS answers, no userinfo, no HTTPS downgrade, and standard sensitive-header stripping on cross-origin redirects.
- Stopped treating provider catalog hosts or sensitive-header declarations as implicit network authorization. Explicit caller-supplied `allowed_hosts` remains fail-closed, while public Royal Society, IOP, and AIP asset CDNs use the baseline URL policy when no allowlist was requested.
- Replaced manual browser-cookie matching with the standard cookie jar policy so host-only/domain, RFC path, secure, expiry, HttpOnly, and SameSite scope are retained.
- Centralized URL/query/header/text secret redaction for human and structured logs, added defensive MCP filtering, and replaced per-request global handlers with one ref-counted router plus context-local request ownership. Live environments now have a value-free mapping representation, and every CI artifact/release upload is gated by a scanner that detects raw and URL-encoded credential sentinels while reporting only variable names and paths. Request targets are lock-invalidated before bridge teardown, so workers retaining a copied context cannot emit into an ended MCP session or an overlapping request; closed loops are rejected before a notification coroutine is constructed.

### Fixed — capability-scoped cache correctness and scale

- Added one `CapabilityScopeBuilder` for API credentials and browser state actually injected into a successful context. Browser-backed scopes bind provider, backend, canonical storage-state path, and the final file digest; empty configured paths stay public, while an actually used state can never be written as public. The legacy environment-only digest remains byte-for-byte compatible with existing private sidecars.
- Made `prefer_cache` normalize a known DOI locally and inspect exact sidecars before any resolver/provider enrichment. Loader, `get_cached`, compact projection, cache-index listings, entry resources, and generated MCP resources enforce exact-private-to-public fallback only. Unchanged DOI-local artifacts retain their independently proven scope instead of inheriting the latest canonical sidecar; missing/legacy provenance and conflicting sidecar scopes fail closed. Every resource read re-evaluates current API/storage-state capabilities and file/index integrity, so revoking a capability also revokes already-advertised URIs without requiring a resource resync.
- Moved cache discovery and hashing outside the global index lock, bounded YAML front-matter reads, persisted stat/content fingerprints for unchanged-file reuse, merged concurrent refresh/rescan updates, and replaced post-write rescans with incremental upserts. Fifty-DOI bulk or sequential refreshes open each unchanged Markdown file at most once.

### Fixed — atomic commits, cancellation, and batch identity

- Unified artifact, sidecar, Markdown, cache-index, and run-summary publication behind path-scoped locks, unique same-directory staging files, flush/fsync, atomic replace, and one linearizable runtime commit fence. Non-overwrite writes now treat identical content as idempotent and reject different content; explicit overwrite permits serialized atomic replacement.
- Carried one runtime context through every single sync/async fetch and output stage. Async cancellation now fences commits, waits a bounded independent grace period, and prevents late workers from publishing artifacts or progress; batch items use isolated child contexts and close duplicate or not-scheduled children as well.
- Kept resolve/check output input-ordered and input-sized with stable indices, terminal status/error/provider lane, and honest terminal/not-scheduled progress. Title checks use resolved provider lanes while known DOI checks use local lane identity, preventing one provider cooldown from stopping unrelated lanes.
- Added canonical DOI representative/fan-out execution for MCP and CLI batch fetch plus a shared cross-request DOI/request/scope/path singleflight key with cancellation-isolated waiters and safe result/error copies.
- Split immutable run semantics from overridable execution policy in resume manifests. Concurrency and continue/retry/rate policy can change safely while ordered inputs, fetch/render/output semantics, and tool version remain fixed; legacy embedded execution fields migrate after validation.

### Fixed — bounded binary assets and browser session reuse

- Added one thread-safe per-article `AssetBudget`, shared across body figures, supplementary files, direct/browser discovery, arXiv source decoding, and image conversion. Defaults are 128 retained files, 32 MiB per file, 256 MiB total, 64 million pixels, and at most four workers further capped by the route.
- Restored browser-owned image, file, and PDF bytes (`response.body()`, `arrayBuffer()`, `bodyB64`, canvas, and browser download payloads) while keeping Content-Length/actual-byte, MIME, pixel, aggregate-budget, cancellation, unique staging, fsync, and atomic-publication checks. A direct 401/403 may enter one genuine browser-byte recovery, but the same URL and session state are not replayed through direct HTTP again.
- Persisted or rolled back completed futures in completion order while preserving input-ordered lightweight results. Fatal byte/file/pixel limits remove all staging files, stop queued work cooperatively, and retain the first diagnostic, while an external RuntimeContext cancellation continues to propagate. EPS/TIFF and arXiv PDF rendering use path-to-path conversion with output byte/pixel checks; source archives count every encountered regular member before name validation/deduplication and enforce the same member/aggregate limits without unbounded reads. Archive decoding now lives in the bounded `_arxiv_source_archive` module without widening the existing `_arxiv_assets` complexity gate.
- Reused hostname-keyed shared connection pools and cookie jars across consecutive figure and supplementary phases. AMS, Annual Reviews, and Springer now declare an independent `assets` route capped at two workers, under the unchanged global cap of four.
- Added explicit `assets` routes for every provider that downloads body resources, with a 20-second direct attempt and a route cap of two; routes with reliable browser recovery no longer add transient direct retries. Each article permits one direct probe per host, then reuses a verified browser path for same-host assets without persisting the decision across papers. ACS/AIP no longer let one CDN connection consume roughly 120 seconds, and MDPI no longer repeats the same direct 403 for every same-host image.
- Added per-asset phase timings for queueing, candidate resolution, URL/DNS policy validation, connect-to-headers/TTFB, body streaming, browser recovery, retry waits, conversion, save, and total time, plus separate browser-context prepare/release stage timings. IEEE custom recovery retains the same timing/route fields when merging logical assets. Reports aggregate phases, terminal status, download tiers, and quality reasons without persisting signed URLs.
- Prioritized Wiley `/doi/{doi}` and replaced the main-document 401/403 readiness skip with a bounded review. Such a candidate is accepted only after stable body readiness, an exact DOI match, no challenge or explicit no-access signal, and the existing Markdown/full-text acceptance; the result and trace retain the real status, and a failed review advances to the next candidate. Science may reuse accepted preflight HTML while blocking heavy resources, and PNAS readiness is aligned with its `#bodymatter` parser selectors. IEEE preflight reuse was tested and rolled back because three live trials did not meet the end-to-end retention threshold; its per-asset timing remains. For image quality, arXiv source archives, Copernicus JATS `graphic` alternatives, and the largest AIP `srcset` rendition now take precedence; T&F keeps its current official CMS preview when no original exists. Audited previews report `official_full_size_not_exposed` or `official_full_size_access_restricted` and are never mislabeled full-size.
- Added opt-in strict body-asset acceptance through `require_local_body_assets` and `require_full_size_body_assets` across Python, MCP, CLI, batch, cache fingerprints, and manifests. Both default to false; full-size implies local, and an unmet constraint degrades asset/overall acceptance without converting an acquired full text into a fetch failure.
- Made HTTP-200 article shells actionable: bounded redacted ACS diagnostics retain document/request/console/challenge signals and page/storage fingerprints, identical route/profile/storage/page states stop immediately, and only a changed candidate, profile, or storage state permits one retry. Live preflight keys now bind provider, canonical DOI, target, and runtime fingerprint; terminal records are appended for both successes and failures.
- Split doctor provenance into `source_development` and `installation` scopes. Source runs audit the checkout bundle and active skill without importing unrelated PATH or legacy offline roots; explicit `--install-root` and packaged runs retain strict installation audits.

### Fixed — executable route, identity, and MCP contracts

- Added one compiled `RouteExecutionPolicy` as the provider-catalog-to-runtime boundary. It combines exact/suffix/base, API/CDN/template and route hosts, and drives HTTP/browser/PDF timeout, retry, QPS/rate wait, acceptance, asset scope, and route concurrency. Oxford PDF, PLOS XML/DOI/assets and arXiv source archives now consume exact compiled routes; provider-owned requests no longer override them with parallel constants. The catalog default now uses the runtime `dns_error` category, including Copernicus suffix hosts.
- Enforced arXiv Atom and source-asset pacing at one request per three seconds across workers sharing a transport scope. A per-scope serialized start gate releases host concurrency while queued; deterministic fake-clock coverage proves a late `Retry-After` moves queued starts to 10/13 seconds rather than releasing them together, and cancellation remains observable.
- Made compiled route asset scope the default selector only when `asset_profile` is unset; explicit `none|body|all` remains authoritative. Route acceptance now evaluates the matching identity, HTML, XML, PDF or audited/local-asset facet, and unknown policies fail closed.
- Classified provider identity evidence as strong or weak. A stale/conflicting domain candidate's `no_access` is retained diagnostically but no longer blocks a strong DOI provider; only a strongly confirmed access boundary terminates the waterfall. DOI-less acceptance now requires one verified unique canonical landing identity rather than a title.
- Completed the advertised MCP v2 cache asset facet and batch artifact `route`/`failure_code` fields, with payload-key/schema subset contracts. Provider registration now detects normalized alias, DOI-prefix, exact/suffix-domain and cross-overlap conflicts; intentional overlaps require distinct priorities and reasons and never depend on import order.

### Fixed — executable provider evidence and regression gates

- Made provider governance consume the real corpus loader. Only 140 fixtures with a canonical raw asset, exact expected contract, and executable current adapter count as replay; 2 synthetic and 15 manifest-only claims remain visible but cannot cover a route. The two synthetic IEEE PDF claims now require their own owned, expiring waiver.
- Extended the block manifest with negative kind, exact route/source identity, reason, failure code, and content kind. All 17 checked-in negative raw HTML responses now run through the current provider extractor and availability boundary; historical extracted Markdown is no longer evidence.
- Added four deterministic provider-level shards to ordinary CI so all 140 exact fixtures run exactly once on every push/PR. Added machine-readable focus coverage baselines that aggregate coverage.py's official pure branch exits, fail closed on unmatched/unmeasured/branchless areas, report covered/total plus exact and floored percentages, and enforce a 90% security-boundary minimum.
- Covered PDF fallback compatibility scoping, browser-navigation origin and response guards, and request-context PDF refetch edges so the 64% PDF-risk branch gate remains executable under the refreshed PyMuPDF4LLM 1.28.2 graph instead of weakening the baseline.
- Replaced concentrated evidence debt with 10 route and 13 negative route-specific waivers carrying owner, restriction, concrete plan, review date, and independently staggered expiry; governance rejects missing/expired/overlong/shared-expiry entries.
- Added a non-blocking scheduled canary for four public, credential-free direct routes. Reports are preserved as artifacts, consecutive failures persist through the Actions cache, warnings start only on the third failure for the same route, and a success resets the counter.

## 5.5.0 - 2026-08-25

### Added — exact acquisition provenance

- Kept the legacy `source` scalar unchanged and added `acquisition={provider,route,representation,transport,fallback_used}` to fetch envelopes, articles, Markdown front matter, acceptance, manifest v2, MCP fetch/cache/batch payloads, and cache-index entries. Exact route and transport facts come from the provider route catalog; unavailable facts remain `null` and make provenance partial instead of being guessed from `source`.
- Raised the fetch-envelope sidecar version to 5 so pre-acquisition v4 sidecars are reported as stale and refetched, while existing Markdown files remain readable with `acquisition=null`. Provider waterfalls now stamp the winning catalog route without changing established public `source` values or legacy source-trail markers.
- Required complete provenance to agree with the catalog route, source owner, and structured fallback trace; manifest auditing now detects Markdown acquisition drift. Generated route documentation exposes `api|browser|http`, success traces retain the exact winning route, and the additive contract is covered by core CI without changing manifest or MCP schema v2.

### Fixed — formula assets, equation fallbacks, and Markdown links

- Fixed Wiley/Atypon display equations whose empty MathML exposed only a numbered label: structured TeX still wins, otherwise the official formula image is used before visible text; label-only equations remain explicitly unavailable instead of becoming pseudo-math, and complete display-math blocks survive Markdown post-processing.
- Allowed explicit formula URLs such as `math-N`, `_IEqN`, and `_EquN` inside figure captions to enter formula asset discovery while preserving the main figure and leaving ordinary equation-related graphics classified as figures. Publisher-supplied bitmap-only formulas remain truthful `download_tier="preview"` assets but are accepted previews, so intrinsically small or duplicate formulas no longer raise placeholder or fidelity-degradation issues; real payload and path defects remain diagnostic.
- Reconciled Springer/Nature `media.springernature.com/lwNN/...` rendition aliases with their `/full/...` downloads before asset acceptance. A successfully archived formula or figure is now counted once as a local logical asset instead of leaving a duplicate remote-only record that falsely degrades Manifest audit with `missing_path` and `asset_below_request`.
- Stopped root-relative publisher assets from being rewritten as nonexistent `../../cms/...` paths. Only existing local files become relative links, downloaded assets still take precedence, and unmatched `/cms/...` links use a valid publisher landing page to remain complete remote URLs or stay unchanged when no valid base exists. Preview fallback warnings are now asset-neutral.

## 5.4.1 - 2026-08-19

### Fixed — compatible Camoufox offline snapshots

- Raised the supported Camoufox line to `>=0.5.5,<0.6` and refreshed the development/CI lock to 0.5.5.
- Removed the POSIX offline builder's Camoufox-only exact `uv.lock` override. Offline builds now derive the selected version from the resolved wheelhouse while still requiring one Camoufox wheel and verifying wheel metadata, the installed distribution, and the recorded manifest version agree. This prevents frozen rolling snapshots containing a newer compatible Camoufox wheel from being rejected by an older source lock.

## 5.4.0 - 2026-08-18

### Added — on-demand Camoufox runtime preparation

- Added first-use preparation for the managed Camoufox browser runtime on CLI browser paths. `paper-fetch fetch`, `paper-fetch auth`, and `paper-fetch browser-preflight` now prepare a missing runtime only when browser work is actually requested, using the official Camoufox CLI for installation, repair, and update checks. Valid runtimes are checked at most once every 24 hours, and a failed update continues with the existing valid runtime.
- Added structured preparation progress, a 900-second child-process deadline, cooperative cancellation, failure cooldowns, and a cross-process file lock so concurrent commands share one installation attempt. Runtime probing rejects managed paths that escape the Camoufox root or traverse symlinks/junctions before any repair is attempted.

### Changed — explicit browser networking policy

- Added `--browser-auto-prepare` / `--no-browser-auto-prepare`, `PAPER_FETCH_BROWSER_AUTO_PREPARE`, and MCP request-level `browser_auto_prepare` controls. CLI browser commands default to enabled; MCP tools and direct library calls default to disabled so service and embedded modes never acquire browser binaries merely by being invoked.
- Kept explicit custom browser binaries outside managed-runtime mutation, and kept static diagnostics, `provider_status`, offline installers, and offline package verification free of browser downloads. Synchronized the Linux, Windows, and native macOS CI contracts, regression coverage, operator documentation, and bundled skill guidance with the new boundary.

## 5.3.2 - 2026-08-17

### Changed — formula and release integrity

- Updated KaTeX from 0.18.1 to 0.18.4 in both development and bundled formula manifests and lockfiles, incorporating settings-object prototype-pollution hardening and parser fixes. The machine contract and unit tests now reject declaration or lock drift between the two copies.
- Updated the pinned `actions/attest-build-provenance` action from v4.1.1 to v4.2.2 while retaining the existing subject-path interface. The exact action name, version, full SHA, use count, and input are synchronized across the macOS contract, validator, tests, audit, and deployment documentation.

## 5.3.1 - 2026-08-10

### Fixed — Wiley browser access detection

- Fixed Wiley full-text and Open Access pages being classified as `publisher_paywall` solely because the current header places `Institutional login` within the first 1,000 visible characters. Once the existing provider body-readiness check confirms substantive article content, navigation-only paywall and not-found text is deferred to the body-aware availability assessor; challenge pages, HTTP 401/402/403, HTTP 404, explicit access denial, and abstract redirects still fail closed.
- Kept `Institutional login` as a generic access-gate signal for pages without substantive body readiness, and added end-to-end Wiley browser-preflight, shared signal, Linux CI, native `macos-15`, and macOS adaptation-contract regressions.

## 5.3.0 - 2026-08-10

### Added — browser reuse and observability

- Added bounded, one-shot in-process reuse of accepted preflight HTML for PNAS, AMS, MDPI, Royal Society Publishing, Annual Reviews, ACS, IOP, and Taylor & Francis. Cache entries are bound to the provider, normalized DOI, candidate URL, and browser runtime fingerprint; formal fetches still re-run metadata, Markdown/asset extraction, and acceptance, while challenges, empty shells, PDF fallbacks, failed pages, and uncommitted storage state are never reused. PNAS and AMS also retain short-lived, DOI-scoped hints for the last accepted provider route.
- Added browser diagnostics for navigation counts, blocked resource types and requests, readiness budgets/results, preflight reuse, and candidate reordering. Catalog live tests now retain matching timing evidence and an observational PNAS preflight-plus-fetch target without turning performance variance into an access-boundary failure.

### Changed — browser and asset performance

- Made browser loading policy provider-specific: the eight opted-in providers block only image, font, and media requests while preserving document, stylesheet, JavaScript, and API traffic. PNAS now uses one complete navigation with canonical candidate ordering and an eight-second body-readiness budget; MDPI retries incomplete intermediate HTML candidates before PDF fallback, and Royal Society Publishing recognizes its current Silverchair article containers without a fixed wait.
- Preferred direct high-resolution figure URLs from download/media links, `srcset`, and original-image attributes for ACS, Annual Reviews, and Royal Society Publishing. Missing originals are discovered serially through one runtime-owned Camoufox figure page with a two-second wait and URL memoization, after which direct asset downloads retain their normal concurrency.
- Batched same-origin Taylor & Francis CSV table hydration with four bounded workers, a shared total deadline, stable input ordering, and per-table embedded-data fallback instead of issuing each table request sequentially.
- Extended regular Linux and native `macos-15` CI with the same non-Science browser performance and asset-regression gate, and synchronized the macOS adaptation contract, audit, and maintenance documentation.

### Fixed — runtime isolation and supplementary assets

- Kept AIP Camoufox cookies and storage state within the owning `RuntimeContext`; cold HTML retries can reuse their transient seed inside one fetch, but preflight HTML, cookies, and storage state are no longer published across runtime-fingerprint boundaries.
- Memoized IEEE multimedia discovery and IOP supplementary-index resolution within each request context using canonical, redacted URLs. Rotated signing parameters no longer trigger duplicate discovery/download work or leak into cache keys, and IOP deterministically reuses both successful index parsing and stable extraction failures.

## 5.2.1 - 2026-08-08

### Changed — build and release integrity

- Updated the pinned `haskell-actions/setup` build action from v2.11.0 to v2.12.0 and synchronized the macOS machine contract, validator, tests, and documentation. The action's GHCup 0.2.6.2 update retains GHC 9.10.3, Cabal 3.12.1.0, texmath 0.13.2, and the existing artifact interfaces.
- Added an independent `uv lock --check` quality gate so stale project-version, dependency-declaration, or lock metadata changes fail CI before the remaining static checks.

## 5.2.0 - 2026-08-07

### Added — Taylor & Francis Online

- Added Taylor & Francis Online (`tandf`) support with browser-rendered article HTML, bounded same-origin CSV and already-loaded same-page table-payload hydration, browser-seeded PDF fallback, provider-managed abstract-only degradation, figures, MathML formulas, supplementary material, and references.

### Fixed — Taylor & Francis browser setup

- Added a verified open-article target for `paper-fetch auth tandf` and `paper-fetch browser-preflight --provider tandf`, so their default invocation no longer fails during target resolution when `--url` is omitted.
- Classified article-scoped Taylor & Francis CMS figure renditions as accepted previews, including valid wide figures that fall outside the shared dimension threshold, so body-asset acceptance does not report a false fidelity loss.

## 5.1.1 - 2026-08-06

### Fixed — Elsevier XML fidelity

- Restored Elsevier formulas that expose only a `link` locator by resolving the
  highest-fidelity official object image at the formula position. Downloaded
  local assets remain preferred, remote official URLs support no-asset mode,
  and image fallbacks retain explicit degraded-quality accounting without OCR.
- Parsed each CALS `tgroup` with its own column model across the Elsevier and
  shared JATS paths. Multiple source groups now render in order under one
  caption, preserve source prefixes and rows, and report degradation only for
  groups that actually require a readable-list fallback.

## 5.1.0 - 2026-08-06

### Fixed — batch request deadlines

- Fixed CLI and MCP batches consuming each paper's request deadline during
  upfront identity resolution and provider-lane queueing. Each fetch worker now
  starts with a fresh request budget while retaining its item-local resolution
  cache and shared transport, preventing browser routes from incorrectly
  falling back to metadata-only solely because the batch waited before fetch.

## 5.0.1 - 2026-08-04

### Changed — dependency compatibility

- Upgraded the locked `trafilatura` release to 2.2.0 and synchronized the Royal
  Society Publishing table golden contract. Literal pipes in statistical table
  headers now remain valid GFM `\|` escapes instead of being parsed as extra
  columns.
- Refreshed the locked compatible dependency graph to
  `apify-fingerprint-datapoints` 0.14.0, `cachetools` 7.1.7, `cffi` 2.1.1,
  `coverage` 7.15.3, `cryptography` 50.0.0, `filelock` 3.32.2, `isbnlib2`
  3.11.21, `pip` 26.2, `ruff` 0.16.1, and `uvicorn` 0.52.1. The
  `cryptography` update fixes `CVE-2026-69247` and restores a clean audit of
  the fully locked dependency graph.

## 5.0.0 - 2026-08-03

### Added

- Rebuilt the macOS adaptation against `Dictation354/paper-fetch-skill` v4.1.0 (`fc3bd96e8d781667a2e86e90dc6e8e35a8a26fa7`) with a machine-readable contract, validator, layered audit matrix, and portable Windows/WSL maintenance gates. The contract documents how to replay the isolated adaptation on a refreshed upstream main branch and keeps `/mnt/*` WSL checkouts limited to static evidence.
- Added fail-closed macOS installation checks for the minimum OS, manifest and checksums, an exact checksummed regular-file inventory with payload symlinks forbidden, standard-GIL CPython ABI and architecture, recursive quarantine state, package/staging path ownership, atomic artifact publication, safe purge, owned upgrades, user configuration, and symlink-preserving Zsh startup updates. Unlisted payload files and purge requests made through symlinks are rejected before user integrations are changed.

### Breaking

- Upgraded all MCP success/error and acceptance payloads from schema v1 to schema v2 and removed the duplicated `quality.trace`; `FetchEnvelope.trace` is now the sole complete trace owner, metadata/assets retain `article_type` and `preview_accepted`, and asset summaries distinguish accepted/fallback previews with stable issue codes. Consumers that require schema v1 must upgrade before adopting 5.0.0. Legacy v1 fetch-envelope caches remain read-only migratable.
- Removed the advertised but unimplemented IOP XML/TDM placeholder route, so catalog/status/docs now expose only executable IOP HTML, PDF, metadata, and supplementary capabilities.

### Changed — macOS and packaging

- Pinned native macOS arm64 offline builds for CPython 3.11–3.14 to `macos-15`, including relocatable texmath Mach-O dependency closure, ad-hoc signing, safe archive extraction, canonical `LC_RPATH` validation, recursive `xattr` checks, and executable Playwright Node verification.
- Split portable Windows/WSL contract evidence from native macOS evidence. Regular CI now runs the native filesystem-alias node and a serial dual-context test against the pinned official Camoufox `152.0.4-beta.28` app bundle; the test validates the managed cache before Camoufox can inspect or clean it.
- Kept browser extras on the compatible `camoufox>=0.5.4,<0.6` line while using `uv.lock` as the reproducible concrete-version source. POSIX packaging resolves that locked version, verifies the downloaded wheel metadata and installed distribution, then records the verified version in the offline manifest. Immutable-tag rebuilds must pass the source checkout's current Mac contract before any overlay; trusted POSIX/Windows tooling refs require full commit SHAs, copy only exact packaging-tool paths, never copy Python wheel source, and are recorded separately in artifact provenance.

### Fixed — macOS and packaging

- Declared `packaging` as a core runtime dependency for provenance checks, and ran macOS contract validation through the locked project environment so clean core installs and native/offline CI runners do not fail on an undeclared or invisible dependency.
- Fixed concurrent or resumed CLI batches colliding on `unknown_unknown_article.*` when a metadata-poor result had no title or DOI. Output naming now falls back to a deterministic 16-character SHA-256 digest of the normalized query, preserving no-overwrite safety without exposing full query URLs in filenames.
- Fixed prepared official Camoufox app bundles failing to start on native macOS. Managed runtime readiness remains a no-download check, but paper-fetch no longer passes `Contents/MacOS/camoufox` back as a custom executable and therefore no longer makes Camoufox look for `Contents/MacOS/properties.json`. Ephemeral fetch/preflight and persistent authentication contexts share this behavior, while explicit custom executable overrides remain supported.
- Fixed MCP cache index, fetch-envelope, and resource misses when macOS exposes a temporary scope through `/var` or `/tmp` but canonicalizes saved paths through `/private/var` or `/private/tmp`; equivalent roots now share one safe scope while in-scope symlinks and out-of-scope files remain rejected.

### Changed — runtime and provider validation

- Removed the scheduled/manual GitHub Actions workflow for live publisher/MCP,
  provider-drift, and full golden-corpus checks; these opt-in checks now retain
  only their documented local pytest and script entry points.
- Made live publisher samples declare accepted source-and-trail outcomes, use lazy browser preflight with shared storage state, and run under marker-aware socket policy without a global force-enable override. Springer success coverage now uses an OA research article; the historical Nature news item remains a separate access-gate behavior sample.
- Promoted the publisher catalog live suite from full-text smoke coverage to a hard `asset_profile=body` acceptance gate, with report/JUnit artifacts that distinguish recorded complete providers from skipped or otherwise unrecorded catalog entries; protected IEEE GIF recovery now lives in a separate authorized-runner opt-in suite.

### Fixed — runtime and providers

- Preserved the first stable challenge/paywall/access-boundary reason when a later browser candidate fails at transport/navigation, either the next candidate or the conservative retry exhausts the shared deadline, and kept that `no_access` classification through provider-owned PDF waterfalls. Live acceptance now recognizes both explicit `status=no_access` errors and the successful metadata fallback's exact `route:provider_candidate_*_access_boundary_stop` marker, while leaving extraction, empty-shell, and incomplete-body regressions as failures.
- Recognized Springer/Nature `Client Challenge` shells (including the `_fs-ch-` runtime marker) and stopped returning them as provisional abstract/metadata articles; MDPI now waits for a stable article-body DOM instead of accepting a delayed HTTP-200 head-only shell.
- Authenticated native macOS CI Camoufox release discovery with the workflow's read-only GitHub token, preventing pinned runtime preparation from failing under GitHub's anonymous API rate limit.
- Made IEEE preflight, browser landing/full-text, and shared asset seeding wait up to 15 seconds for a matching article-number `#article`; persistent AWS WAF HTTP-202 pages now report `aws_waf_challenge` with compatibility diagnostics, while pages that become ready are no longer rejected from their initial response. Protected large-asset recovery still stays direct-first, primes its preview once, and preserves full-size recovery/fallback provenance.
- Stabilized AIP and the shared browser-workflow cold HTML retry by carrying provider-scoped transient cookies from the fast attempt into the normal attempt without persisting unaccepted state; after an HTTP-200 `empty_article_shell`, the retry now prioritizes the next existing provider URL instead of repeating the same head-only landing. Diagnostics retain both attempts, response status, and DOM readiness while PDF remains a terminal fallback.
- Fixed live browser-provider capability gating to read the nested `browser_runtime.available` result, isolate provider profiles/storage state, and reuse Camoufox's prepared executable and dependency cache across pytest isolation; explicit launches reuse adjacent version metadata, and startup progress is kept off MCP JSON-RPC stdout.
- Preserved pre-page browser failures as privacy-safe diagnostic JSON, propagated request-scoped formula tool configuration into implicit MathML conversion, corrected body-only asset acceptance/provenance semantics, and recovered signed Silverchair originals without cross-thread Camoufox page access.
- Kept ordinary publisher/MCP live suites and protected IEEE coverage as separate documented local-only entry points; shared-state tests remain serial and retain legacy-compatible JUnit properties plus structured acceptance artifacts.
- Prevented IEEE browser DOM extraction from treating `captcha` or access tokens inside non-visible script/template markup as a block page; visible challenges remain rejected, and validation now leaves the page's own REST subrequests unblocked.
- Added the documented `status=ok` and compact seven-facet acceptance summary to successful single-paper MCP fetch responses, using the same canonical evaluator and projection as batch fetches.
- Reclassified successfully expanded HTML/JATS/CALS row and column spans as normal table normalization, retaining structural reason codes without emitting false layout-degradation warnings; malformed span or column metadata still degrades conservatively, and the extraction revision now invalidates stale cached quality results.
- Fixed request deadline initialization, AIP/Science DOM readiness, and browser preflight classification so local fast-path caps do not exhaust later fallbacks and page/extraction failures retain privacy-safe diagnostic artifacts.
- Made Springer/Nature HTML retrieval reuse the hardened cookie-aware requester with one fresh-session retry for `cookies_not_supported`, preserved Research Briefing article type, and stopped valid authorless briefings from receiving `empty_authors`.
- Reconciled IEEE small/large variants by canonical logical identity, restored parallel direct asset downloads while keeping shared-page browser recovery serial, and separated asset download, fidelity, placeholder, and remote-only acceptance facts.
- Removed trace triplication and the warning-count quality heuristic; repeated codes from real retry attempts remain ordered, while arbitrary operational warning text no longer degrades successful content.
- Enforced zero external socket attempts in ordinary unit tests, closed the three batch resolver seams, diagnosed inactive source-checkout `.venv`/incompatible MCP versions, and retained diagnostic files in both successful and terminal-failure manifests.
- Added independent browser/DOM/HTTP/retry/asset/render timing and provider-route-stage nearest-rank performance summaries with observed-only output for single samples and p50/p95 for repeated samples.

### Limitations

- Offline packages include the Camoufox and Playwright Python dependencies but not the Camoufox browser binary. Prepare it explicitly with `python -m camoufox fetch` before entering a restricted or offline environment, then run `paper-fetch browser-preflight`. A reproducible browser-backed fetch in a fully network-isolated native macOS environment remains an open audit item, so complete offline browser support is not claimed.

## 4.1.0 - 2026-07-29

### Added

- Introduced route-level provider contracts and governance: the runtime catalog now records route order, availability, browser requirements, timeouts, concurrency, rate policy, acceptance, and asset scope; generated route/catalog snapshots, route-family golden replay coverage, expiring evidence waivers, and scheduled corpus/provider-drift checks keep code, manifests, fixtures, and docs aligned.
- Added shared typed failure diagnostics, route-attempt timing summaries, remote JSON root/schema guards, fail-closed public URL validation, and a configurable PDF transfer ceiling so provider, HTTP, workflow, CLI, manifest, and MCP surfaces retain the same machine-readable failure facts.

### Changed

- Upgraded the required MCP Python SDK from 1.x to `mcp>=2,<3`, migrated the server and protocol-model accessors to the v2 `MCPServer` API, replaced the custom stdio pump with the official transport, and retained both legacy 2025 handshake compatibility and modern 2026-07-28 protocol/resource-subscription support.
- Reworked FetchEnvelope caching around DOI plus request fingerprint variants and one-way credential-capability scopes; public, token, and browser-state requests can coexist without overwriting or leaking into one another, while compact cache projections retain deterministic request and acceptance evidence.
- Centralized publisher identity, route discovery, batch lane concurrency, browser capability, and source ownership in the runtime provider catalog; versioned PLOS journal routes, Springer site-family profiles, and direct-first Frontiers canonical routes now expose explicit diagnostics instead of relying on scattered heuristics.
- Hardened the shared HTTP/cache runtime with credential-scoped identities, non-persistence of sensitive/private responses, redacted redirect diagnostics, indexed disk-cache reconciliation and pruning, bounded transient retry categories, and host/provider cooldown waits that release concurrency slots.
- Expanded provider extraction and asset handling across Frontiers, Oxford Academic, IEEE, IOP, PLOS, Springer, and Wiley, including stronger JATS identity/body validation, direct-first assets, explicit unarchived supplementary records, selected-browser state propagation, and route-specific PDF recovery.

### Fixed

- Prevented browser/PDF fallbacks from accepting challenge or non-PDF responses, exceeding shared deadlines and transfer limits, crossing origin or credential boundaries, or leaving partial artifacts after cancellation and failed downloads.
- Corrected JATS formula, table, figure, reference, and supplementary rendering so provider identity mismatches fail closed, semantic losses remain visible, and content/assets cannot be promoted to complete acceptance without the required evidence.
- Returned discarded redirect and failed HTTP responses to the blocking connection pool after closing them, preventing concurrent Springer figure discovery from exhausting every connection slot and hanging fetch or offline-release smoke checks.

## 4.0.2 - 2026-07-28

### Fixed

- Unified HTML, JATS, and Elsevier/CALS table conversion behind a provider-neutral cell/grid normalizer; flattened multi-row headers, supported named CALS spans, preserved full-width groups, expanded safe rowspan/colspan semantics, and retained irregular grids as readable lists with accurate fallback/layout diagnostics instead of semantic-loss misclassification.
- Corrected Royal Society Publishing Silverchair figure extraction to preserve signed CDN originals from `DownloadImage.aspx`, model `/view-large/figure/` as an HTML discovery page instead of an image, reject cross-figure grouped-slide URLs, and use selector-driven viewer fallback before preview degradation.
- Follow bounded PLOS manuscript redirects to signed Google Cloud Storage XML, while redacting all `X-Goog-*` query values and excluding credential-bearing redirect responses from HTTP caches.
- Restored AMS to the shared Camoufox HTML and browser-seeded PDF workflow so AWS WAF HTTP 202 verification pages are classified as challenges; stateless fetch remains allowed, while `paper-fetch auth ams` and `PAPER_FETCH_AMS_STORAGE_STATE_JSON` provide optional reusable browser state.
- Migrated ACS extraction to the current Silverchair article structure, preserving the complete `.article-body`, tables, figures, MathML formulas, structured references, and stable article-supplement links while excluding embedded Figshare viewer content and figure UI chrome; refreshed all three ACS golden fixtures, made fixture PDF capture reuse the selected browser runtime, and stopped full-size figure pages from waiting for article-body readiness.
- Reused one ready IEEE article browser context/page for protected full-size figures, tables, multimedia, and supplementary assets, preserving current cookies and the article Referer without navigating the shared page to asset URLs; aligned HTTP 403/HTML challenge retry selection with the existing browser recovery policy.

## 4.0.1 - 2026-07-27

### Fixed

- Restored native texmath 0.13.2 as the preferred formula backend in Linux, macOS, and Windows offline packages, copied reused POSIX binaries instead of preserving build-host symlinks, and retained the locked `mathml-to-latex` package as the secondary fallback.
- Normalized relative Windows installer output directories before invoking Inno Setup, and allowed stable-release retries to overlay trusted packaging tooling without moving an immutable source tag.
- Restored the daily `dependency-latest` rolling prerelease after the 4.0 CI split, resolved the `full` extra for all nine frozen platform/ABI snapshots, reused the shared offline workflow for verified wheelhouse builds, and reinstated exact asset replacement and post-publication integrity checks.
- Made Chinese the sole language for future release notes: stable releases extract their version section from `CHANGELOG_CN.md`, while rolling prereleases use the Chinese status template instead of generating English notes.

## 4.0.0 - 2026-07-26

### Breaking

- Removed the deprecated CloakBrowser backend and all `CLOAKBROWSER_*` compatibility settings. Camoufox is now the only supported browser backend.
- Made the default installation a lightweight core. Browser extraction and PDF conversion now require the `browser`, `pdf`, or `full` extra.

### Changed

- Added branch-aware global and risk-focused coverage reporting, full-package typing, isolated unit-test runtime state, bounded cookie-aware downloads, and hardened XML parsing.
- Consolidated project version metadata around `pyproject.toml`, adopted SPDX license metadata, and expanded release and supply-chain metadata.

### Fixed

- Stabilized shared PDF Markdown structure under `pymupdf4llm` 1.28.0 by repairing deterministic heading drift without provider- or DOI-specific rules.
- Deduplicated Royal Society Silverchair figures across `view-large` and CDN URL variants while preserving the preferred full-size URL, preview URL, label, and caption.
- Refreshed and agent-reviewed all 26 affected golden snapshots after removing duplicate HTML title sections and applying the PDF and Royal Society fixes.

## 3.2.1 - 2026-07-25

### Changed

- Updated all GitHub Actions Python setup steps from `actions/setup-python@v6` to `actions/setup-python@v7`.
- Expanded the deprecated CloakBrowser compatibility range from `>=0.4,<0.5` to `>=0.4,<0.6`, covering the 0.5.x Python wrapper while keeping Camoufox as the sole default browser backend.
- Upgraded KaTeX from `0.17.0` to `0.18.1` and synchronized the root and bundled formula-tool manifests and lockfiles.

## 3.2.0 - 2026-07-22

### Added

- Added browser-neutral runtime context/session contracts for native Firefox/Juggler Camoufox and deprecated CloakBrowser, with provider-scoped state and a formal backend guide.
- Added direct-first selected-browser recovery across IEEE landing, REST HTML, PDF, figure/table/formula assets, multimedia discovery, and supplementary files; recovery is limited to eligible authentication, HTML-challenge, and network failures.
- Added a daily `dependency-latest` rolling prerelease that resolves the full direct/transitive Python runtime dependency matrix from the latest stable `v*` release, rebuilds all nine offline installers only when the source or resolved wheel set changes, and supports an explicit `force_refresh` recovery run.
- Added dependency snapshot tooling and contracts for per-target wheel inventories, deterministic cross-platform manifests, dependency-set comparison, and pre-build wheel filename/SHA256 verification.

### Changed

- Made Camoufox the sole default browser backend. CloakBrowser remains available throughout 3.x only when explicitly selected, emits a one-time `FutureWarning`, and may be removed in 4.0.0; legacy `CLOAKBROWSER_*` variables no longer select it implicitly.
- Kept backend selection strict with no automatic cross-backend fallback, required every runtime config to carry its backend, and separated Camoufox/CloakBrowser profile state.
- Constrained Playwright to `<1.61` for the supported `camoufox>=0.5.4,<0.6` combination, reused one thread-affine Camoufox process per runtime context, and optimized full HTML navigation around `commit` plus provider DOM readiness without global image/font/style blocking.
- Reused the existing Linux, macOS, and Windows offline build jobs for rolling updates with frozen wheelhouses; publishing retargets the fixed prerelease, replaces and verifies its exact installer/manifest/checksum asset set, and treats incomplete or invalid prior assets as a rebuild trigger without changing the stable latest release.

### Fixed

- Fixed IEEE large/preview media duplication so each normalized inline asset renders once, and distinguished partial asset downloads from batches where every asset failed.
- Fixed rolling offline builds failing before packaging when clean `setup-python` environments lacked the resolver-only `packaging` dependency; `merge`, `compare`, and pre-build `verify` now remain standard-library bootstrap paths.
- Fixed rolling prerelease publication against an older stable source commit by using a repository-scoped `ROLLING_RELEASE_TOKEN` for tag and Release mutations while keeping the built-in job token read-only.
- Fixed trailing commas in Windows offline-installer environment arrays that caused PowerShell parser errors before packaging began, with a static regression contract covering all three release scripts.
- Fixed stable release publication being skipped by GitHub's implicit `success()` status check when the dependency chain contained intentionally skipped refresh jobs; the release condition now always evaluates and explicitly requires every direct quality gate and offline build to succeed.

## 3.1.3 - 2026-07-15

### Added

- Added stable browser lifecycle failure codes for managed Chrome profile, startup, CDP, context, and page stages, with bounded redacted stderr diagnostics propagated through browser preflight, provider traces, fallback payloads, CLI manifests, and agent guidance.

### Changed

- Changed CLI and MCP batch execution to retain one shared browser manager across item gaps and use cooperative cancellation with a grace period, one-time browser shutdown escalation, and first/second Ctrl-C handling in the CLI.
- Expanded the macOS offline browser smoke and unit contracts to cover conservative stale-profile recovery, four-worker/50-context reuse, cancellation convergence, diagnostic redaction, and fallback provenance.

### Fixed

- Fixed managed Chrome profile reuse after abnormal exits by validating singleton ownership, host, PID/profile, and socket state; only proven-stale links are archived with recovery metadata, and a failed launch is retried at most once after a newly stale set is recovered.
- Fixed browser/PDF and metadata fallbacks so precise HTML/browser failure traces survive a successful fallback and keep acceptance degraded; browser runtime failures now direct users to repair local runtime state instead of incorrectly suggesting publisher authentication.

## 3.1.2 - 2026-07-14

### Changed

- Changed HTML full-text acceptance to require a trusted article/body container scope plus substantive body evidence, preserved the original scope through synthetic `<article>` normalization, and raised `EXTRACTION_REVISION` to 3 so stale false-positive sidecars are refetched.
- Added a focused offline CI gate and a real Annual Reviews empty-shell replay for shared availability, provider fallback, and block-corpus regressions.

### Fixed

- Fixed landing pages with empty full-text markers and large Most Read, Most Cited, Recommended, or Related modules being promoted to full text solely by page text volume.
- Fixed Annual Reviews empty landing shells so they fail HTML quality assessment and continue through the existing PDF fallback; retained Wiley abstract datalayer blocking for `10.1002/joc.3370130706`.

## 3.1.1 - 2026-07-14

### Added

- Added bounded IOP supplementary expansion for `asset_profile=all`, resolving same-DOI `/data` indexes to `SM`-numbered attachments with browser cookie/Referer reuse.
- Added a focused CI contract gate for IOP supplementary extraction, explicit asset Referer forwarding, signed-URL redaction, and browser challenge regression coverage.

### Fixed

- Fixed IOP supplementary discovery so `/data` index HTML, figure download controls, QR images, mismatched parent DOIs, blocked indexes, and empty scopes cannot be accepted as supplementary files; unresolved declared indexes now surface structured asset failures.
- Fixed browser-backed supplementary file requests to forward their explicit Referer and redact AWS `X-Amz-*`, `Signature`, and `AWSAccessKeyId` query values from cache keys and retained asset diagnostics.

## 3.1.0 - 2026-07-13

### Added

- Added canonical asset acceptance and manifest-v2 records across CLI, MCP, cache, and durable batch runs, including deterministic output hashes, audit/reconcile/resume support, bounded concurrent execution, cancellation, and rate-limit stop semantics.
- Added network-free provider/runtime diagnostics, browser preflight and provider catalog MCP resources/tools, compact cache inspection, and the structured `batch_fetch` MCP tool with explicit persistence and resume modes.
- Added machine-readable installation provenance to `paper-fetch doctor --json`, covering source and distribution versions, the default User-Agent, PATH entrypoint, offline target/revision/build metadata, installed runtime metadata, and all three host skill copies.

### Changed

- Changed the static skill into a thin, self-contained workflow entrypoint with dedicated workflow, presets, acceptance, CLI, environment, tool-contract, and failure-handling references whose links are parser-validated in source, staging, and installer copies.
- Changed offline manifest schema to version 3 so Linux, macOS, and Windows bundles carry the complete skill file list and a SHA256 for every file; installers now reject missing, extra, symlinked, or hash-drifted skill content before and after host installation.
- Prepared the backward-compatible feature set as the SemVer minor release `3.1.0`, synchronizing package metadata, the stable tool User-Agent, Windows installer fallback version, deployment guidance, and both changelogs.
- Added a lightweight cross-CLI/MCP/cache/manifest CI contract gate; package smoke now builds outside the checkout and verifies version consistency, every console script, MCP EOF, and static installation provenance while keeping live/offline heavy jobs opt-in.

### Fixed

- Fixed version ambiguity that could leave source, installed distribution metadata, and the PATH CLI at different releases without exposing their concrete paths; source development without an offline manifest is now reported as not applicable instead of an installation failure.

## 3.0.1 - 2026-07-04

### Changed

- Changed the built-in Wiley and Science samples used by `paper-fetch browser-preflight` and `paper-fetch auth` to lighter full-text pages already covered by fixtures, reducing slow parsing time in the default browser preflight.
- Added a built-in Royal Society Publishing sample for `paper-fetch browser-preflight` and `paper-fetch auth royalsocietypublishing`, so the default browser preflight now covers that browser-backed provider.
- Removed the full GitHub Actions unit/devtools/coverage job from the default CI gate; local `scripts/dev-preflight.sh` still runs the complete unit, devtools, and optional coverage checks.
- Refreshed user and agent documentation: restored the README showcase and example screenshots while keeping the quick-start path compact, corrected AMS direct-HTTP/browser-runtime wording, aligned CLI `--output-dir` filename descriptions with paper-stem output naming, and replaced completed-provider onboarding examples with placeholder provider examples.

## 3.0.0 - 2026-07-03

### Changed

- Changed browser-backed providers to use the public `browser_runtime` backend facade, centralizing CloakBrowser storage/profile path resolution, storage-state locking, and atomic storage-state writes across auth, preflight, HTML fetch, and seeded PDF fallback.
- Changed external CDP handling to report borrowed-context diagnostics and support `PAPER_FETCH_CDP_EXTERNAL_NEW_CONTEXT=1` for creating a fresh context in an existing browser.
- Changed browser-backed asset downloads to reuse a scoped thread-local page/context during safe caller-thread attempts, with automatic fallback to per-call close on Playwright thread-ownership errors.
- Changed browser image fetches to use a single per-image wall-clock budget across seed warming, page fetch, request-context fetch, direct navigation, and image wait; PDF fallback browser seeding now uses a lightweight warm path and skips duplicate seed navigation when cookies were already collected.
- Changed local conversion paths to cache Ghostscript/libvips candidate and `--version` probes, keep existing formula result/worker reuse under subprocess-call tests, and reuse no-image PDF Markdown rendering by PDF hash with byte/page guards and render diagnostics.
- Added cooperative cancellation checks to browser HTML, seeded PDF fallback, browser asset retry, and browser preflight loops.
- Changed `paper-fetch browser-preflight` to reuse each browser-backed provider's normal HTML candidates and HTML bootstrap retry semantics for built-in samples while still skipping PDF fallback.
- Removed the PNAS fast browser HTML preflight special case; PNAS now uses the standard browser workflow HTML bootstrap before seeded PDF fallback.
- Changed AMS to a no-browser direct HTTP HTML provider with direct HTTP PDF fallback, publishing `ams_html` or `ams_pdf` while still skipping browser auth/preflight/status and seeded-browser PDF fallback.
- Changed CI offline package jobs to run only on `v*` tag pushes or manual dispatch, leaving ordinary push/PR runs to the regular quality gates.
- Changed quality gates to expand mypy coverage to runtime/config/quality/PDF fallback/browser-runtime/formula core paths, configure mypy with `no_site_packages`, enforce a unit coverage baseline of 40 in CI and local coverage preflight, and remove the global `tests/**` `B023` ruff ignore.
- Changed offline installers to derive MCP, `offline.env`, shell, and activation runtime environment keys from `installer/manifest.json`, propagate bundled Node/Python encoding consistently, register Antigravity MCP in verifier coverage, and parse `activate-offline.sh` env files without executing shell code.
- Changed `RuntimeContext.parse_cache` accessors to use a lock and same-key in-flight coordination so concurrent parser memoization runs each supplier once.
- Changed MCP tool outputs to include top-level `schema_version=1`, preserve provider/HTTP error details in machine-readable fields, and stop batch submission on rate-limit categories, HTTP 429, or retry-after hints while retaining `abort_reason.retry_after_seconds`.
- Changed MCP cache-index reads to validate `INDEX_VERSION`, reject stale/invalid manifests unless explicitly rescanned, expose `list_cached(cache_mode="index"|"refresh"|"rescan")`, keep structured resolve `title`/`authors`/`year` as independent resolver signals, and move provider/Crossref primary-secondary metadata merge semantics into one rule-backed helper.
- Changed provider waterfalls to continue fallback routes consistently for access, rate-limit, no-result, and generic provider failures while deduplicating aggregated warnings/source trail and preserving retry-after details in final failures.
- Changed provider registry cold-start behavior so root `paper_fetch` imports no longer load provider entry modules, `trafilatura`, or `idutils`; provider discovery now uses an explicit built-in entry list plus cached AST checks for dynamic entries, and browser workflow route labels live in `route_order` instead of string-valued `waterfall_steps`.
- Changed shared Markdown table rendering to use one canonical pipe-table formatter across IR and HTML paths, preserving explicit headers, escaping pipes/newlines, padding ragged rows, and rendering fallback messages.
- Changed HTML-derived formula and citation rendering to keep inline TeX math delimited, prefer explicit figure context before formula-image URL heuristics, and share one numeric citation payload helper across section and Atypon renderers.
- Updated README, CLI/MCP instructions, provider/runtime/deployment/extraction docs, AMS onboarding manifest/access-review/cleaning-chain evidence, and the provider runtime optimization plan to match the new browser-runtime and AMS direct-HTTP ownership boundaries.
- Expanded unit and integration coverage for AMS direct HTTP HTML/PDF fallback, browser-preflight provider candidates/no-PDF behavior, external-CDP new-context diagnostics, browser runtime facade wiring, and browser workflow dependency grouping.

## 2.8.0 - 2026-07-02

### Added

- Added provider-template-aware DOI extraction for DOI-bearing publisher URLs, including query-parameter DOIs, known route/extension suffix stripping, and AMS old-style SICI `view` / `downloadpdf` slug support, so many URL queries resolve directly without fetching a landing page first.
- Added `scripts/dev-preflight.sh --coverage` plus CI unit coverage reports (`term-missing` and `coverage.xml`) as a baseline signal without enforcing a coverage threshold.

### Changed

- Changed publisher-facing landing/PDF requests and browser workflows to use browser-shaped user agents through `build_publisher_user_agent`; `PAPER_FETCH_USER_AGENT` remains the tool/API user agent and no longer becomes the default browser context user agent.
- Changed Royal Society Publishing from direct HTTP DOI/PDF fetching to the shared CDP browser HTML plus seeded-browser PDF workflow while keeping `royalsocietypublishing_html` / `royalsocietypublishing_pdf` sources and the no-XML route contract.
- Changed title-query resolution to prefer a formal journal publication over a near-tie preprint when Crossref metadata identifies a clear formal publication candidate.
- Expanded mypy coverage to 136 project source files, including HTML extraction, browser workflow, Atypon browser workflow, shared JATS/common Markdown helpers, the CloakBrowser helper, service, artifacts, image conversion, and resolver modules.
- Changed local and CI quality gates to enforce `ruff format --check`, keep ruff linting, prefer repo-local `.venv/bin/python` or explicit `PYTHON_BIN`, report missing dev dependencies early, and run local preflight type checks with `mypy --no-site-packages`.
- Applied `ruff format` across the Python codebase and updated module-layout and asset-contract guard tests for the formatted source shape.

### Fixed

- Fixed the expanded mypy contract suite by normalizing BeautifulSoup attribute values before helper calls, preserving optional HTML dependency fallbacks under type checking, and aligning MCP request/resource/result types with the current SDK signatures.
- Fixed browser-backed batch concurrency so managed CDP browser managers are shared process-wide by provider/browser config, preventing concurrent CLI/MCP fetches for the same provider profile from racing on `.paper-fetch-profile.lock`; isolated contexts now use thread-owned CDP connections to avoid cross-thread Playwright sync object reuse.
- Fixed SICI DOI normalization and URL DOI suffix handling so DOI suffixes such as `<...>` / `;` are preserved, while provider route tokens such as Frontiers `/full`, IOP `/pdf`, Wiley `/fullpdf`, and Springer `.pdf` are stripped only when provider catalog templates make that safe.
- Fixed official PDF fallback degradation for scanned/PDF-only provider results: real downloaded PDFs are retained with explicit warnings and provider source trail instead of being replaced by Crossref/general metadata-only results when Markdown extraction is unusable.
- Fixed publisher landing/probe requests that previously sent the stable `paper-fetch-skill/<version>` tool user agent to browser-facing publisher routes.
- Fixed docs and contract drift around `PdfFallbackStrategy`, browser runtime ownership, provider URL/route behavior, and asset-download contract marker scanning after repository-wide ruff formatting.

## 2.7.1 - 2026-07-01

### Added

- Added `paper-fetch browser-preflight` to serially open browser-backed provider sample pages, save provider-scoped storage-state JSON on success, and report providers that need manual `paper-fetch auth`.

### Changed

- PDF/ePDF fallback image exports now use the same DOI-scoped `<doi>_assets/` directory as HTML/XML asset downloads when a DOI is available, while retaining the legacy `body_assets/` fallback for DOI-less internal calls.

### Fixed

- AMS formula image extraction now reads lazy `data-image-src` GIF URLs before `Blank.svg` placeholders, so image-only equations are rendered and downloaded from the real publisher formula assets.
- AMS direct HTTP HTML preflight now follows DOI 3xx redirects to the publisher full-text page before parsing while still rejecting challenge pages, so public AMS articles can stay on the no-browser `ams_html` path instead of falling through to browser/PDF fallback.
- PDF fallback source files now prefer merged provider payload metadata for artifact filenames, so arXiv paths that learn title, authors, and year after fetch no longer fall back to `unknown_unknown_<doi>.pdf`.

## 2.7.0 - 2026-07-01

### Added

- Added AMS direct HTTP HTML preflight with browser-equivalent headers before the CDP browser fallback, reducing browser startup for publicly reachable AMS article pages while preserving the existing browser/PDF recovery route.
- Added AMS `Download Figure` EPS/TIFF source-figure handling: body figure assets now prefer publisher source files, convert them to PNG through Ghostscript/libvips when available, preserve the original source files and conversion metadata, and fall back to webpage JPG/PNG candidates when conversion is unavailable or fails.
- Added optional image conversion tooling (`paper-fetch-install-image-tools`, `install-image-tools.sh`, `PAPER_FETCH_IMAGE_TOOLS_DIR`, `PAPER_FETCH_GHOSTSCRIPT_BIN`, `PAPER_FETCH_VIPS_BIN`, `PAPER_FETCH_EPS_DPI`, and `PAPER_FETCH_IMAGE_TOOL_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`) plus offline installer environment propagation.

### Changed

- Changed Linux, macOS, and Windows offline package builders to configure image-tools paths without bundling build-host `gs`/`vips` symlinks from `PATH`; Ghostscript/libvips remain optional runtime tools.
- Changed arXiv Atom API enrichment to use a 60 second timeout and two transient retries for timeout/5xx failures, and surfaced those settings in provider status diagnostics.

### Fixed

- Fixed direct HTTP browser-workflow asset downloads so a failed AMS asset does not attempt browser seed refresh when no browser runtime was started, and so supplementary downloads inherit the same seeded Referer behavior as body figure downloads.
- Ignored repo-local `.image-tools/` output so local Ghostscript/libvips staging artifacts are not accidentally committed.
- Updated README, provider, deployment, architecture, extraction-rule, offline installer, CI, and unit-test coverage for AMS source figures, image conversion fallback, and offline image-tools behavior.

## 2.6.2 - 2026-06-27

### Changed

- Refreshed the human- and agent-facing documentation to describe the current provider routing, browser runtime, artifact, cache, probe, onboarding, and extraction-rule contracts without stale migration wording, and renamed the browser runtime reference to `docs/browser-runtime.md`.
- Updated CLI and MCP help text for provider authentication and browser storage/profile overrides to describe the current provider-scoped storage-state behavior.

### Fixed

- Updated extraction-rule validation so compatibility-anchor redirects remain accepted after the refreshed extraction rules converted the old "compatible note" wording to current anchor wording.

### Removed

- Removed the stale `problems.md` implementation task draft and the obsolete `docs/legacy-browser-runtime.md` reference.

## 2.6.1 - 2026-06-27

### Fixed

- Fixed LaTeX normalization for MathJax `\unicode{...}` commands, including `\unicode{x2A7D}` -> `\leqslant`, so IOP Markdown output such as `10.1088/1748-9326/ad560b` no longer fails KaTeX parsing with an undefined control sequence.
- Fixed `MarkdownFormula` rendering to apply the shared LaTeX normalization path instead of only generic text normalization.
- Fixed browser-workflow image downloads to prefer explicit `download_url` candidates and reject lazy placeholder images such as `Blank.svg`, `Blank.png`, and `Blank.gif`, preventing Atypon/AMS pages from saving placeholder assets as body figures.
- Fixed seeded browser PDF fallback after async thread handoff to use a thread-local browser context manager while preserving configured profile and user-data directories, avoiding cross-thread runtime browser manager use.

## 2.6.0 - 2026-06-26

### Added

- Added Frontiers (`frontiers`) XML-first provider for `10.3389/` and `frontiersin.org`, with canonical article discovery, shared JATS rendering, figure URL rewriting, direct HTTP PDF fallback, `frontiers_xml` / `frontiers_pdf` sources, manifest, docs, and unit coverage.
- Added `paper-fetch --version` plus CLI help text for reference, asset, and token rendering options.

### Changed

- PDF fallback now honors `asset_profile=body|all` when artifact saving is enabled, exporting PDF-rendered body images to `body_assets/` and surfacing them in article assets/artifacts across direct HTTP and seeded-browser PDF routes.
- PDF fallback source files now use stable, source-derived filenames instead of a single `downloaded.pdf`, reducing collisions when multiple fallback PDFs are materialized in the same artifact directory.

### Fixed

- Fixed IOP figure asset extraction so standard `_lr` / `_online` CDN image links are upgraded to `_hr` high-resolution candidates before preview fallback, allowing IOP HTML fetches such as `10.1088/1748-9326/ad560b` to save full-size body figures when available.

## 2.5.2 - 2026-06-24

### Fixed

- Fixed shared HTML cleanup so semantic attributes such as `data-title`, `alt`, `title`, and `aria-*` no longer trigger chrome noise filtering. This preserves valid body figures whose captions contain words such as "related", including Nature articles where Fig. 2 was dropped from Springer/Nature HTML extraction.
- Added regression coverage to keep Springer/Nature body figure assets with semantic `data-title` text while continuing to remove real related/recommended article chrome identified by structural attributes.

## 2.5.1 - 2026-06-23

### Fixed

- Fixed browser PDF fallback after async thread handoff so it preserves the caller's runtime browser configuration, including provider profile and user-data directories, instead of forcing a fresh non-runtime browser context.
- Added regression coverage for the runtime-browser PDF fallback path to ensure thread handoff still reuses the configured runtime context.

## 2.5.0 - 2026-06-23

This release refactors the CloakBrowser browser path around CDP-managed Chrome reuse and improves anti-bot/challenge resilience through provider-scoped browser state, shared runtime context management, and safer external-browser attachment.

### Added

- Added optional `CLOAKBROWSER_CDP_ENDPOINT` support for attaching browser workflows to an already-running Chrome/CloakBrowser instance over CDP.
- Added managed Chrome startup through CloakBrowser when no endpoint is configured, including provider-scoped profile/storage-state reuse under `publisher-browser-profiles/<provider>`.
- Added provider-scoped browser authentication with `paper-fetch auth <provider>` for browser-backed providers, including built-in sample URLs, `--url` overrides, headed manual verification, and local storage-state saving without requiring `.env` writes.
- Added `CLOAKBROWSER_PROFILE_DIR` plus legacy Wiley storage/profile environment variable awareness so existing user configuration can be identified while the managed CDP path defaults to provider-scoped state.

### Changed

- Changed the browser backend from direct `cloakbrowser.launch()` ownership to a CDP-backed `BrowserContextManager`; HTML fetches, browser-backed asset downloads, fast HTML preflight, and seeded PDF/ePDF fallbacks now share the runtime keyed browser manager where possible.
- Changed managed browser startup to use `cloakbrowser.ensure_binary()` and a local Chrome CDP endpoint; `CLOAKBROWSER_HEADLESS`, `CLOAKBROWSER_BINARY_PATH`, `CLOAKBROWSER_PROFILE_DIR`, and `CLOAKBROWSER_USER_DATA_DIR` now apply to that managed path.
- Changed external CDP mode to borrow the browser's existing context, inject storage-state cookies where possible, and document that new-context options such as user agent and viewport may be ignored by the borrowed context.
- Changed runtime-shared browser-backed asset downloads to run serially in both managed and external CDP modes, opening isolated context/page instances without moving Playwright sync objects across worker threads; ordinary HTTP asset downloads still use the configured concurrency.
- Changed AMS authentication and fetching to use the same provider-scoped storage-state model as other browser-backed providers; `PAPER_FETCH_AMS_STORAGE_STATE_JSON` is now a legacy override instead of a required setup step.
- Changed `paper-fetch auth` legacy AMS-only options (`--state-json`, `--env-file`, `--no-env-write`, `--wait-seconds`) to unsupported compatibility stubs; profile/storage-state location is now controlled by the browser runtime directory configuration.
- Changed browser provider status checks and MCP/skill documentation from CloakBrowser launch terminology to CDP browser runtime / Playwright dependency terminology, including explicit external endpoint and managed-browser behavior.
- Changed offline installers, offline package builders, and CI smoke checks to validate Playwright, CloakBrowser `ensure_binary`, and `BrowserContextManager` instead of probing the removed direct `cloakbrowser.launch()` path.
- Changed generated offline environment files and installer messages to document `CLOAKBROWSER_CDP_ENDPOINT`, managed Chrome startup, default `CLOAKBROWSER_HEADLESS`, and browser user-agent defaults for browser-backed publishers.
- Changed the CloakBrowser dependency constraint to `cloakbrowser>=0.4,<0.5`.

### Fixed

- Fixed managed headless Chrome startup so paper-fetch appends Chrome's native `--headless=new` flag when CloakBrowser omits a headless argument, preventing ordinary browser-backed CLI fetches such as Wiley from opening a visible browser window.
- Fixed browser-backed image and file fetchers so managed CDP mode reuses the runtime keyed browser manager instead of starting independent Chrome instances, avoiding same-profile lock deadlocks while preserving isolated context/page use.
- Fixed browser-backed figure asset downloads in batch and single-paper CLI runs so runtime-shared Playwright/CDP objects stay on their owning caller thread, eliminating `greenlet`/`TargetClosed` failures and preserving local figure asset output for CloakBrowser-backed providers.
- Fixed managed browser profile locking to use a timeout instead of blocking forever when another managed browser already owns the profile directory.
- Fixed CDP startup polling so a responsive `/json/version` endpoint with a temporarily missing `webSocketDebuggerUrl` no longer spins without sleeping.
- Fixed fast HTML preflight, browser-backed asset fetchers, and browser PDF fallback to carry binary path, CDP endpoint, profile directory, user-data directory, and storage-state configuration consistently into the browser context manager.
- Fixed seeded PDF fallback HTTP retry cookies to request and filter cookies for the target URL before replaying the PDF request.
- Fixed provider status handling so managed browser mode can report browser-backed providers as ready without requiring a preconfigured external endpoint or AMS storage-state JSON, while still rejecting invalid managed binary paths and malformed CDP endpoints.
- Fixed offline installer activation and MCP environment registration so managed CDP browser variables are exported consistently and obsolete profile/binary variables are not propagated as MCP env keys.

## 2.4.1 - 2026-06-20

### Changed

- Bumped the CloakBrowser dependency floor to `0.3.32`, improving browser-route adaptation to publisher anti-bot and automation-detection changes; all users are encouraged to update.

## 2.4.0 - 2026-06-18

### Changed

- Refined the packaged skill instructions: paper-fetch now explicitly applies to DOI, URL, arXiv ID, title, citation, and search-generated candidate workflows that need reading, summarization, comparison, translation, critique, full-text fetch, or readability checks; ordinary read/summarize tasks default to no local save unless the user asks for archival output, and browser-runtime guidance now follows `ProviderSpec.requires_browser_runtime` instead of a hard-coded provider list.
- Hardened HTML byte decoding across provider and asset fetch paths: `decode_html()` now honors UTF-8 BOM/UTF-8, HTTP `Content-Type` charset, HTML meta charset, `charset-normalizer`, and UTF-8 replacement fallback, with Springer, IEEE, browser workflow, generic provider, and figure-page paths passing response content type where available.
- Reduced repeated HTML parsing and DOM cloning overhead in Annual Reviews, Royal Society Publishing, IOP, shared author/reference helpers, and arXiv helpers. Pure BeautifulSoup string-reparse clones now use bs4 node copies, while raw MathML fragment parsing remains explicit for AMS.
- Centralized arXiv official HTML parser selection through `ARXIV_HTML_PARSER = choose_parser()` after fixture tests confirmed the `lxml` parser path remains compatible.

### Fixed

- Made generic HTML cleanup cheaper on pages without `article`, `main`, or `role=main`: no-root cleanup now skips per-node noise classification while retaining tag, selector, and ORCID removal, and content-root selection avoids repeated full-subtree text extraction.
- Capped raw trafilatura fallback at `1_000_000` characters so large original HTML is no longer sent to trafilatura after cleaned HTML fails; cleaned fallback parsing still runs.

## 2.3.0 - 2026-06-14

### Added

- Added Antigravity CLI (`agy`) as a third install target alongside Codex and Claude Code. The new `scripts/install-antigravity-skill.sh` copies the static skill (user scope `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/skills/`, project scope `./.agents/skills/`, overridable via `ANTIGRAVITY_HOME`) and, with `--register-mcp`, merges the local stdio server into the appropriate `mcp_config.json` (`command`/`args`/`env`) while preserving any existing server entries. The offline installers (`install-offline.sh`, `scripts/windows-installer-helper.ps1`) now install the Antigravity skill and `mcp_config.json` too, with matching uninstall handling and CI coverage.

### Changed

- Broadened the ruff lint ruleset from `E4,E7,E9,F,TID251` to additionally enforce `UP`, `B`, `SIM105`, and `RUF022`, and applied the resulting fixes across the codebase: `typing` ABC imports migrated to `collections.abc`, `datetime.timezone.utc` rewritten to `datetime.UTC`, `try`/`except`/`pass` blocks replaced with `contextlib.suppress`, an explicit exception chain added to `run_provider_waterfall` (`raise ... from exc`), and explicit `zip(..., strict=...)` at the sites the new rules surfaced. `B008` is ignored project-wide (the MCP `default_mcp_deps()` argument default is an intentional dependency-injection seam) and `B023` is ignored under `tests/`.
- Extended mypy `files` coverage beyond the model/workflow/mcp/http contract surface to additional foundational modules (`metadata`, `markdown`, `extraction/markdown_render`, `tracing`, `reason_codes`, `arxiv_id`, `normalize_journal_name`, `section_vocab`, `logging_utils`, `publisher_identity`, `provider_catalog`, `extraction/citation_anchors`), raising the analyzed set from 45 to 68 files, with the type fixes required to keep the check green.
- Stopped tracking the ad-hoc batch-debugging output under `failures/` and three unreferenced raw fetch artifacts under `figures/`, and added both to `.gitignore` to prevent re-committing them.
- Bumped the bundled `mathml-to-latex` formula backend from 1.5.0 to 1.8.0, syncing the version across the root and `src/paper_fetch/resources/formula/` package manifests and lockfiles.

## 2.2.1 - 2026-06-12

### Changed

- Disk cache entry iteration no longer reads each cache file's JSON payload to extract `stored_at`; `st_mtime` is used directly, removing O(n) file reads from every `_prune_disk_cache` call.
- Disk cache reads in `_load_disk_cached_entry` no longer hold the exclusive `_disk_cache_lock` during file I/O; concurrent cache reads no longer serialize behind a single lock.
- `_sensitive_cache_header_names` and `_cache_key_header_names` are now computed once per process via `@functools.cache` instead of calling `provider_sensitive_header_names()` on every HTTP request.
- `prepare_html_extraction_tree` eliminates the redundant second BeautifulSoup parse; the HTML tree is now pruned in place and serialized once instead of being serialized to string and re-parsed into a fresh soup object.
- `html_cleanup_rules` is now memoized with `@functools.lru_cache(maxsize=32)` so repeated calls with the same noise profile within a single extraction pipeline share a single `HtmlCleanupRules` instance.
- `choose_parser` evaluates `importlib.util.find_spec("lxml")` once at import time and returns a module-level constant on every call.
- `classify_dom_cleanup_node` now references a module-level `_HEADING_TAG_RE` constant instead of compiling `re.compile(r"^h[1-6]$")` twice on every element visit.
- `_inline_image_contents` performs a single `path.stat()` call per asset instead of a separate `path.is_file()` followed by `path.stat()`.
- `run_blocking_call` uses the default asyncio thread-pool executor instead of creating a dedicated per-call `ThreadPoolExecutor`; log bridge lifecycle in `batch_resolve_tool_async` and `batch_check_tool_async` now uses `ExitStack`.
- `mark_envelope_cached_with_current_revision` is now a `None`-returning mutation instead of returning the modified envelope.
- Expanded mypy coverage to include the `paper_fetch.mcp` and `paper_fetch.http` packages; added missing type annotations and `cast` calls to satisfy strict checking.
- Relaxed `mcp` version constraint from `>=1.27,<1.28` to `>=1.27,<2`.

### Fixed

- `parse_retry_after_seconds` now handles fractional `Retry-After` values such as `"0.5"` or `"1.5"` by parsing through `float()` before truncating to `int`; previously these fell through to the HTTP-date parser and were silently discarded.
- `_mcp_log_level` no longer returns `"debug"` as the fallback for log records with a level above `CRITICAL`; the fallback is now `"critical"`.

## 2.2.0 - 2026-06-10

### Added

- Reuse the warmed in-page article `<img>` via canvas export as the first browser-workflow image-recovery step; when the target image exists but has not finished loading, perform a credentialed in-page `fetch()` for the raw image bytes before falling back to direct URL request, page fetch, and navigation candidates (affects `wiley`, `science`, `pnas`, `ams`, `annualreviews`, `acs`, `iop`, `aip`, `mdpi`).

### Changed

- Derive Atypon/Wiley figure caption labels from explicit labels, the figure DOM id, the image URL basename, or a caption that starts with `Figure N`, and read the `.figure__title` selector; a mid-caption `Figure N` cross-reference can no longer override the figure's own number.
- Consolidate browser-workflow asset-download internals with no behavior change: a single generic per-thread document fetcher backs both the image and supplementary fetchers, image/file fetchers reuse the shared browser response-header/status helpers, the two attempt-fetcher builders collapse into one (dropping unused parameters), and a shared `dedupe_normalized` utility replaces four copies of ordered URL de-duplication.

### Fixed

- Stop formula images from masquerading as figures: a node whose only image is a formula image yields no figure asset, formula-image anchors rewrite only as formula assets, and when one image URL matches both a figure and a formula the formula semantics win, so formula images no longer consume inline figure slots.
- Key inline figure injection off both image alt text and image URL basename, and skip a body `Figure N` cross-reference when that figure already appears as a Markdown image, so a repeated or label-less figure can no longer trigger a second inline insertion.

## 2.1.0 - 2026-06-08

### Added

- Add `paper-fetch auth ams` to open a headed CloakBrowser session, save AMS storage-state JSON, and optionally write `PAPER_FETCH_AMS_STORAGE_STATE_JSON` to the paper-fetch user environment file.
- Add Elsevier PII URL resolution for ScienceDirect and LinkingHub `/pii/...` URLs, including provider identifier propagation and official Elsevier Abstract PII API metadata lookup before the normal DOI full-text path.

### Changed

- Require explicit `PAPER_FETCH_AMS_STORAGE_STATE_JSON` for AMS browser workflow and provider status checks; AMS no longer relies on stateless browser startup or `CLOAKBROWSER_USER_DATA_DIR` as its authentication source.

### Fixed

- Try Springer PDF fallback when accepted Springer HTML still renders to abstract-only Markdown, instead of returning abstract-only before PDF recovery.
- Prefer formally published Crossref title-query candidates over near-duplicate preprints when both appear in the candidate set.
- Detect Springer article-in-press notice text as an availability blocker when no post-abstract body is present, avoiding false full-text acceptance.
- Avoid duplicating IOP appendix figure captions and suppress repeated non-inline figure asset captions that are already present in rendered Markdown.

## 2.0.0 - 2026-05-28

### Changed

- Derive MCP provider guidance from the runtime provider catalog so accepted provider hints, browser-runtime providers, and public source names stay aligned with registered providers.
- Refresh public provider and extraction documentation for the current provider catalog, including Annual Reviews, Royal Society Publishing, PLOS, Oxford Academic, ACS, IOP, AIP, MDPI, AMS, Science, and PNAS route details.
- Mark browser-workflow providers through provider specs instead of maintaining separate hard-coded browser-runtime provider lists.
- Update Codex skill installation, offline installer, deployment, and onboarding documentation around the supported installation surface.

### Removed

- Remove the Gemini skill installer and legacy Codex MCP runner scripts from the shipped script surface.

### Fixed

- Keep CloakBrowser workflow labels, provider docs drift checks, offline install checks, and skill template tests synchronized with catalog-derived provider facts.

## 1.9.0 - 2026-05-27

### Added

- Add AIP Publishing (`aip`) provider routing for `10.1063/` and `pubs.aip.org`, with CloakBrowser article HTML, seeded-browser PDF fallback, `aip_html` / `aip_pdf` sources, body figure/table/formula/supplementary extraction, and provider-managed abstract-only degradation.
- Add two-step provider onboarding human gates with `prepare-human-preflight` and `finalize-review-artifact` so users review waterfall/access once, then batch-confirm final Markdown quality instead of editing every fixture review by hand.
- Add IOP Publishing (`iop`) provider routing for `10.1088/` and `iopscience.iop.org`, with CloakBrowser article HTML, seeded-browser PDF fallback, `iop_html` / `iop_pdf` sources, and Radware/hCaptcha challenge rejection.
- Add real IOP fixture coverage for table, formula, and PDF fallback purposes with `10.1088/2058-9565/ac3460` and `10.1088/1748-9326/aa9f73`.
- Add ACS (`acs`) provider routing for `10.1021/`, `www.acs.org` / `pubs.acs.org`, shared CloakBrowser HTML plus seeded publisher PDF/ePDF workflow, replay-backed table / formula / Supporting Information coverage, and direct public `/doi/pdf` fallback capture with seeded browser-navigation headers.

### Changed

- Tighten provider fixture discovery so Crossref candidate searches can be DOI-prefix filtered, off-provider DOI candidates are dropped before probing, and challenge/access/empty-shell probes cannot rank as high-confidence fulltext fixtures.

### Fixed

- Re-approve the IOP replay fixture coverage so the real `10.1088/1748-9326/ab7d02` capture now covers the supplementary purpose through the article-scoped `stacks.iop.org` media link.
- Require ACS body figure assets in the onboarding contract and preserve ACS figure image links through browser-workflow cleanup so downloaded body figures rewrite Markdown to local asset paths.

## 1.8.0 - 2026-05-26

### Added

- Add PLOS (`plos`) provider routing for `10.1371/` DOI and `journals.plos.org`, using public JATS XML first, direct HTTP PDF fallback, provider-managed metadata fallback, and `plos_xml` / `plos_pdf` sources.
- Add Oxford Academic (`oxfordacademic`) provider onboarding for public HTTP article HTML, validated article-PDF fallback, `oxfordacademic_html` / `oxfordacademic_pdf` sources, provider manifest, access review, cleaning proposal, and benchmark samples.
- Add PLOS and Oxford Academic golden corpus coverage with real replay fixtures, expected Markdown summaries, markdown-quality reports, and representative fixtures.

### Changed

- Extend onboarding automation, fixture capture, manifest sync-back, and cleaning-chain proposal tooling for the PLOS and Oxford Academic provider workflows.
- Refresh provider documentation, extraction-rule evidence, onboarding runbooks, and known-provider manifests for the new providers.
- Update Royal Society Publishing PDF fallback expected payloads and markdown-quality fixtures after shared PDF rendering cleanup.

### Fixed

- Follow PLOS signed figure-image redirects during asset downloads and rewrite refreshed PLOS figure golden replay Markdown to local `body_assets`.
- Render PLOS graphic-only JATS formulas as inline formula image assets instead of `Formula unavailable` placeholders.
- Preserve Oxford Academic Silverchair formula paragraphs and render references from visible reference-list text instead of raw `citation_reference` meta keys.
- Keep Oxford Academic golden corpus count guards in sync with the new provider fixtures and representative sample.

## 1.7.0 - 2026-05-24

### Added

- Add Annual Reviews (`annualreviews`) provider for `10.1146/` DOI routing, CloakBrowser-rendered HTML full text, seeded-browser PDF fallback, provider-managed abstract-only degradation, fixture replay, golden corpus coverage, and HTML body figure extraction.

- Add Royal Society Publishing direct HTTP HTML provider with strict PDF fallback.

### Fixed

- Wait for Annual Reviews dynamic full-text DOM containers during fast browser fixture capture, and stop treating institutional "access provided by" labels as paywall blockers while keeping them as Markdown cleanup noise.
- Classify browser PDF fixture downloads that return non-PDF payloads as `NON_PDF_FALLBACK_CONTENT` instead of a network transient, and require replacing the failed PDF sample before onboarding resumes.
- Refetch browser PDF fallback responses through the browser request context when Chromium exposes a PDF viewer shell instead of the underlying PDF bytes.
- Allow manifest-driven fixture capture to reuse an already registered DOI fixture when multiple onboarding purposes share the same article.
- Avoid classifying publisher access UI as an access gate during fixture capture when the captured page has a populated full-text container.
- Preserved Royal Society Publishing Silverchair figure captions and stripped Royal Society PDF fallback watermark/page placeholder noise from Markdown.
- Derived DOI values for known MDPI numeric article URLs before generic landing-page fetches, and derived MDPI article landing URLs from known MDPI DOI suffixes before falling back to `doi.org`.
- Synced the bundled formula Node workspace to `katex` 0.17.0 so root and formula package lockfiles stay aligned.
- Replaced invalid UTF-8 bytes from external formula converter subprocess output instead of letting Windows reader threads raise `UnicodeDecodeError`.
- Replaced invalid UTF-8 bytes from PyMuPDF's Windows Tesseract-probe subprocess output during PDF fallback Markdown conversion.

## 1.6 - 2026-05-22

### Added

- Added experimental macOS offline release tarballs for CPython 3.11, 3.12, 3.13, and 3.14, with CI installation checks, headful layout validation, and CloakBrowser smoke coverage.
- Added the MDPI CloakBrowser HTML provider with browser PDF fallback, recorded replay fixtures, Markdown cleanup coverage, and `mdpi_html` / `mdpi_pdf` sources.
- Added operator access-review and provider Markdown-review artifacts for AI provider onboarding, with schema-backed gates before discovery and acceptance.
- Added a local `scripts/dev-preflight.sh` gate plus low-strength contract-layer `mypy` checking, formula Node package sync tests, and golden corpus provider adapters for easier provider onboarding.

### Changed

- Changed manifest-driven fixture capture to support `--all` batch capture and changed provider scaffold replay to return merge-plan JSON when generated files already exist.
- Tightened live review to compare provider sources against manifest `route_sources` and reuse manifest Markdown contracts for automatic issue classification.
- Enabled the normal Chrome browser User-Agent in offline installer-managed `offline.env` blocks by default so CloakBrowser-backed AGU/Wiley fetches are less likely to stop at Cloudflare challenge pages.
- Derived MCP status, live review support, and golden corpus representative coverage from provider facts instead of hard-coded provider lists where possible.

## 1.5.6 - 2026-05-18

### Fixed

- Fixed Windows offline installer smoke checks by running bundled Python probes from temporary `.py` files instead of passing multi-line scripts through `python.exe -c`, avoiding PowerShell native-command quote stripping around CloakBrowser checks.

## 1.5.5 - 2026-05-17

### Fixed

- Restored the Wiley full-text waterfall after Cloudflare/challenge HTML failures so browser PDF/ePDF fallback and then the optional Wiley TDM API PDF lane are still attempted before provider-managed metadata-only fallback.
- Kept the AGU/Wiley Cloudflare workaround centered on `PAPER_FETCH_BROWSER_USER_AGENT` with headless CloakBrowser as the usual runtime path.

## 1.5.4 - 2026-05-17

### Changed

- Changed Linux offline release assets from `.tar.gz` bundles to single self-extracting `.sh` installers with `--install-dir <path>` support and the default install root `~/.local/share/paper-fetch-skill`.
- Changed Linux and Windows offline upgrades to clear the old runtime payload before installing the new runtime-only payload while preserving user-authored `offline.env` content and refreshing managed environment, PATH, skill, and MCP registration blocks.
- Changed Linux offline uninstall semantics so `--uninstall` removes only user-level shell/skill/MCP integration and `--purge` explicitly deletes the fixed install directory.

### Fixed

- Prevented the Windows offline installer from aborting after runtime files are installed when optional post-install integration or smoke checks fail on a user machine; warnings are now logged to `install-helper.log`.
- Fixed Linux offline installer CloakBrowser checks and Claude MCP registration arguments for current host CLIs.
- Fixed browser PDF fallback so CloakBrowser/Playwright sync work is handed to a worker thread when the caller is already inside an asyncio loop.

## 1.5.3 - 2026-05-17

### Changed

- Changed the Windows offline installer to package only the embedded runtime, installed packages, command wrappers, static skill, formula tools, and installer metadata, removing the repository source snapshot and build wheelhouse from the installed payload.

## 1.5.2 - 2026-05-17

### Changed

- Changed Linux offline tarballs into preinstalled runtime packages with `bin/` launchers and `runtime/site-packages/`, without the repository source snapshot or target-machine wheelhouse; installation no longer runs pip.

### Fixed

- Prevented Atypon browser HTML routes for Wiley, Science, PNAS, and AMS from treating residual Cloudflare/challenge text as an HTML-route failure once a stable full-text DOM is already present.

## 1.5.1 - 2026-05-17

### Fixed

- Updated browser workflow User-Agent handling so CloakBrowser/Playwright contexts no longer inherit the default `paper-fetch-skill/<version>` HTTP UA unless users explicitly configure a browser UA.
- Added `PAPER_FETCH_BROWSER_USER_AGENT` for browser-only UA overrides while keeping explicit `PAPER_FETCH_SKILL_USER_AGENT` as a compatibility fallback for browser contexts.
- Documented the AGU/Wiley Cloudflare challenge workaround using a normal Chrome browser UA with headless CloakBrowser.

## 1.5 - 2026-05-16

### Added

- Added the CloakBrowser-backed browser runtime abstraction and provider status diagnostics, replacing the FlareSolverr runtime path.
- Added browser image payload and runtime smoke coverage for the migrated browser workflow.

### Changed

- Migrated Science, PNAS, Wiley, AMS, IEEE browser/PDF flows, MCP diagnostics, live runners, installers, offline packages, and CI from FlareSolverr-specific paths to the shared CloakBrowser/browser runtime path.
- Removed bundled FlareSolverr source, setup scripts, vendor patches, docs, and release-package runtime assets; offline packages now ship the `cloakbrowser` Python package and document that the browser binary is not redistributed.
- arXiv HTML asset handling now recovers figure assets from the arXiv e-print source package when official HTML exposes only missing-image placeholders; source PDF figures are rendered to PNG assets and inserted back near their figure captions while full-text extraction remains official-HTML first.
- Browser workflow concurrent asset downloads now use thread-private browser/context/page instances instead of sharing the `RuntimeContext` browser across worker threads.
- Optimized browser workflow fetching, CLI output-directory handling, provider request options, MCP cache payload handling, and fixture/scaffold docs around the new runtime contract.

### Fixed

- Fixed the Windows offline package builder so the MCP command wrapper PowerShell here-string closes correctly before writing `README.offline.md`.
- Suppressed CloakBrowser's first-launch promotional stderr banner during browser-backed fetches.

## 1.4.1 - 2026-05-15

### Added

- Added native CLI batch fetching with `--query-file`, per-item output files, JSONL batch summaries, bounded `--batch-concurrency`, and per-item failure reporting without aborting the whole batch.
- Added dedicated CLI documentation for output routing, artifact modes, asset profiles, `--save-markdown`, and batch-mode behavior.

### Changed

- Release 1.4.1: native batch CLI and provider/MCP refinements.
- Refined CLI output/artifact semantics so batch and single-query runs consistently separate primary output files from saved Markdown and provider artifacts.
- Updated MCP fetch/cache payload behavior for inline image budgets, cache resource visibility, and schema coverage.
- Hardened Elsevier Markdown and Springer HTML extraction around tables, figures, asset rewriting, and provider-specific cleanup.
- Fixed offline installer smoke checks to use the current MCP provider-status entrypoint during Linux and PowerShell installs.
- Refreshed README, provider, deployment, bundled skill, and tool-contract documentation to match the new CLI and MCP/provider behavior.

## 1.4 - 2026-05-12

### Added

- Added the `arxiv` provider for `arxiv.org` and DOI prefix `10.48550/`, publishing `arxiv_html` on official HTML success with text-only PDF fallback as `arxiv_pdf`.
- Added 10 real arXiv replay fixtures: 8 official HTML success samples and 2 official HTML 404 -> real PDF fallback samples, each with arXiv API metadata replay.

### Changed

- Reworked Phase 1 routing/extraction internals: Copernicus URL identity now uses catalog `domain_suffixes`, early metadata probes are driven by `ProviderSpec.probe_capability`, reference-anchor detection is centralized in HTML semantics, Wiley supplementary data attributes are handled by the Wiley extractor, and Science/PNAS figure teaser filtering now receives the actual publisher.
- Centralized provider source ownership, including Springer HTML/PDF source ownership, API-like hosts, Wiley TDM URL template, Springer/Nature domain matching, workflow HTML-managed fallback markers, and body-text thresholds in `ProviderSpec` / `SOURCE_PROVIDER_MAP`.
- Tightened Phase 4 generic extraction boundaries: Springer/Nature citation cleanup patterns now live in the provider layer, provider formula tokens require explicit `ProviderHtmlRules` profile injection, and Research Briefing authorless signatures live with quality signals.
- Completed Phase 4 duplicate-source cleanup: `FRONT_MATTER_PUBLICATION_KEYWORDS` now has one generic source with Science/PNAS publication tokens scoped to provider rules, `SourceKind` is checked against catalog sources at import time, Cloudflare cookie filters share the FlareSolverr constants, and Science reuses the shared AAAS datalayer pattern.
- Centralized Phase 3 HTML availability overrides and access-gate signals through provider rules and shared signal patterns, including Science perspective, Elsevier canonical abstract, and Springer preview-wall body-run handling.
- Hardened Phase 6 provider-specific contracts: IEEE article-number URL parsing now only accepts `/document/{article_number}/` landing paths, Springer/Nature Creative Commons cleanup no longer removes article roots, and HTML asset helpers avoid importing the public models package during package initialization.
- Completed Phase 7 cleanup: generic browser HTML failures are now `HtmlExtractionFailure`, FlareSolverr status probes use a non-DOI sentinel, landing-page redirect resolution has one request-URL-based semantic, and old FlareSolverr rate-limit env cleanup code was removed.
- Moved Atypon browser HTML/PDF candidate templates into `ProviderSpec` and removed the `paper_fetch.providers.science_html`, `paper_fetch.providers.pnas_html`, and `paper_fetch.providers.wiley_html` compatibility facades.
- Completed Phase 5 Atypon/Wiley cleanup: Wiley owns abbreviations and supplementary filename contracts, datalayer signal parsing uses schema field maps, and Atypon browser workflow scope is documented as Science/PNAS/Wiley catalog entries only.
- Golden criteria live review now includes `copernicus` in the supported provider rotation and provider-status diagnostics.
- Documented Phase 8 CI/test policy updates: regular unit/integration jobs and full golden regression continue to use pytest-xdist defaults, while live FlareSolverr/MCP paths document their required serial execution.
- Clarified CLI output semantics: explicit `--format` with `--output-dir` and stdout output now also writes a same-format document copy under `--output-dir`, while `--output` remains the explicit formatted-output file path.
- Golden criteria live review now treats `arxiv` as a supported provider, records arXiv provider status, preserves derived-URL fallback when arXiv API metadata has transient failures, and classifies arXiv asset partial-download diagnostics as `asset_download_failure`.
- arXiv metadata enrichment now uses a small internal Atom API client for ID lookup and no longer depends on the PyPI `arxiv` / `feedparser` dependency chain.
- arXiv HTML asset downloads now use a provider-specific lower concurrency cap and retry network-exception failures once sequentially while preserving non-retryable failures in `quality.asset_failures`.
- arXiv fulltext routing is now fixed to official HTML first with direct text-only PDF fallback; retired local source-conversion fallback code and related asset handling are no longer part of the supported route.
- arXiv official HTML Markdown cleanup now folds ordinary prose hard line breaks, sanitizes nested `$...$` delimiters inside LaTeXML TeX annotations, and lifts full-width table title rows out of GFM pipe table headers.
- Completed Phase 2 callback cleanup: Atypon DOM postprocess and scoped asset extraction are now provider-registered callbacks, and provider display names resolve through the catalog-backed `provider_display_name()` helper.
- Completed Phase 3 catalog field cleanup: Springer/Nature PDF candidates, arXiv metadata probe short-circuiting, provider HTML artifact persistence, XML source inference, provider-managed abstract-only handling, and PDF URL token semantics are now catalog/callback driven instead of provider-name hardcoded.
- Completed Phase 5 Atypon browser workflow rename: the old Science/PNAS package/profile/postprocess names were moved to `atypon_browser_workflow`, the legacy profiles facade was removed, Atypon profile dispatch now dynamically imports provider HTML modules from `ATYPON_BROWSER_WORKFLOW_PROVIDER_NAMES`, shared figure-link and abstract-redirect helpers live in neutral modules, and Science citation-italic repair now belongs to `_science_html.py`.
- Elsevier XML body asset downloads now retry only failed transient network items once sequentially and remove the original asset failure when the retry succeeds.
- Wiley formula image discovery now includes `data-altimg` fallback spans and display formula containers, so image-only formulas can enter the `kind="formula"` asset download path instead of requiring an `<img>` tag.

## 1.3 - 2026-05-09

### Added

- Added the `copernicus` XML-first provider for Copernicus Publications DOI prefix `10.5194/`, publishing `copernicus_xml` on NLM/JATS XML success with text-only PDF fallback as `copernicus_pdf`.
- Added 8 Copernicus XML golden fixtures across ACP, HESS, GMD, TC, ESSD, NHESS, AMT, and BG, plus 4 older Copernicus PDF-fallback golden fixtures whose XML is abstract-level only; live smoke sample coverage remains behind `PAPER_FETCH_RUN_LIVE=1`.
- Hardened Copernicus fallback handling for older articles whose XML only exposes abstract-level content: those XML failures now continue directly to text-only PDF fallback, and PDF discovery includes DOI-derived `.pdf` candidates when the landing page omits PDF metadata.

### Refactor

- Split `paper_fetch.http` from a single module into a package facade plus internal transport, cache, retry, body, and error modules while preserving the existing public import path.
- Move dev-only `geography_live`, `geography_issue_artifacts`, and `golden_criteria_live*` modules from `paper_fetch.*` to source-tree-only `paper_fetch_devtools.*`; wheels no longer ship those modules, while the existing repo-local script CLIs keep the same behavior.

### Changed

- Copernicus XML extraction now reuses the parsed XML root through validation and article assembly, validates usable body paragraphs with a named threshold, and continues with DOI-derived XML/PDF URLs when landing HTML cannot be fetched.
- Copernicus XML assets now use `original_url` as the canonical remote URL while shared asset download mirrors the compatibility URL fields after download; table assets are emitted directly as `kind="table"` with `table_render_kind`.
- Installer completion summaries now explicitly prompt users to request and configure `ELSEVIER_API_KEY` from <https://dev.elsevier.com/> before Elsevier full-text fetching, and point to the relevant `.env` file.
- Windows offline release artifacts now use `paper-fetch-skill-windows-x86_64-setup.exe` and bundle CPython 3.13 x64, Python dependencies, Playwright Chromium, formula tools, the FlareSolverr runtime, Codex / Claude Code skills, and MCP registration helpers.
- GitHub Actions now creates a GitHub Release on `v*` tag pushes or explicit manual releases after regular validation, the full Linux offline package matrix, and the Windows x86_64 setup exe succeed, uploading 4 Linux tarballs plus 1 Windows installer release asset.
- Expanded body-image payload recognition and persistence formats: in addition to PNG/JPEG/GIF/WebP/AVIF/TIFF, SVG text, BMP, ICO, APNG, and HEIC/HEIF MIME/extension mappings are supported; body images are verified for image magic bytes or top-level SVG document signatures before being saved, avoiding challenge HTML being persisted as images.
- Added Science `10.1126/science.adz3492` to the golden fixtures with real SVG body-image assets to guard against Science/PNAS SVG image persistence regressions.
- Added a fast initial FlareSolverr HTML pass for Wiley / Science / PNAS full-text fetching: primary HTML requests use `waitInSeconds=0` and `disableMedia=true`, then automatically fall back to the original conservative wait strategy on challenges, access blocks, abstract redirects, or insufficient body extraction.
- Image recovery, body/supplementary asset downloads, and figure-page HTML discovery continue to use media-enabled paths so `disableMedia` does not block full-size image discovery or downloads.
- Consolidated duplicate implementations for HTML availability/container handling, section hints, browser-workflow Markdown profiles, author fallback, Crossref resolve forwarding, and HTML heading/table helpers; canonical owners are now `quality.html_availability`, `extraction.section_hints` / `extraction.html.semantics`, `ProviderBrowserProfile` / `_html_authors.py`, and `metadata.crossref`.
- Clarified that the shared Science / PNAS / Wiley browser extraction is an Atypon-only profile, and consolidated asset scope, Wiley abbreviations, Wiley author noise, supplementary URL/filename rules, and AAAS/PNAS/Wiley datalayer detection into provider-owned callbacks/schemas.
- Moved the HTML asset canonical owner to the `paper_fetch.extraction.html.assets` package, removed the `paper_fetch.extraction.html._assets` and `paper_fetch.providers.html_assets` compatibility facades, and made download hooks patch from the extraction asset package or `paper_fetch.extraction.html.assets.download`.
- Materialized `paper_fetch.models` as a package split by schema, markdown, tokens, quality, render, sections, and builders while keeping `from paper_fetch.models import ...` compatible.
- Materialized the Science/PNAS browser-workflow HTML implementation as the `paper_fetch.providers.science_pnas` package, removed the `paper_fetch.providers._science_pnas_html` compatibility facade, and extracted the provider HTML asset policy engine plus Playwright document fetcher base class.

## 1.0.0 - 2026-04-26

### Changed

- Released the package as `1.0.0` and updated the default `paper-fetch-skill/1.0` User-Agent.
- Hardened Wiley / Science / PNAS seeded Playwright image fetching so Cloudflare challenge pages and non-image responses fail quickly instead of stalling a live review.
- Reordered the Wiley full-text waterfall so browser PDF/ePDF fallback now runs before the optional TDM API PDF lane whenever the local browser runtime is ready, keeping `wiley_browser` as the default successful route.
- Added `code_availability` as a first-class section kind. Elsevier, Springer / Nature, Wiley, Science, and PNAS now share data/code/software availability classification, retain those sections in final Markdown/ArticleModel output, and exclude them from body sufficiency metrics.

### Docs

- Documented the short-timeout behavior for seeded Playwright image fetches in the FlareSolverr workflow notes.
- Documented the unified data/code availability retention and quality-metric exclusion rules.

### Validation

- `PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m pytest tests/unit/test_provider_request_options.py`
- `PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m pytest tests/unit/test_science_pnas_provider.py -k 'download_related_assets or image'`
- Live smoke: Wiley `10.1111/gcb.16414`, Science `10.1126/science.ady3136`, and PNAS `10.1073/pnas.2406303121` produced full-text Markdown with full-size body images using the WSLg FlareSolverr preset.

## 2026-04-25

### Changed

- Promoted the Wiley / Science / PNAS browser workflow runtime to [`src/paper_fetch/providers/browser_workflow.py`](src/paper_fetch/providers/browser_workflow.py). Science, PNAS, and Wiley now declare `ProviderBrowserProfile` objects for URL candidates, Markdown extraction, author fallback, public source, labels, and browser asset behavior; `_science_pnas.py` remains a compatibility alias.
- Promoted the Wiley / Science / PNAS HTML asset downloader to a shared Playwright primary path. Figure, table, and formula image candidates now reuse one seeded browser context per download attempt instead of trying direct HTTP first.
- Kept full-size/original candidates ahead of preview candidates, but now fetches both tiers through the same shared browser context. Target-provider downloads report `download_tier="full_size"` or `download_tier="preview"` rather than `playwright_canvas_fallback`.
- Tightened the browser-workflow image recovery path: repeated figure-page / image-candidate URLs are cached per attempt, body-image payload downloads now use fixed limited parallelism with stable output ordering, and FlareSolverr recovery no longer falls back to screenshot cropping when `solution.imagePayload` is missing or invalid.
- Preserved the FlareSolverr seed refresh retry for partial asset failures, while keeping the generic HTTP-first asset downloader unchanged for non-target providers such as Springer.
- Expanded HTML formula handling so Wiley, Science / PNAS shared HTML, and Springer / Nature paths preserve MathML when possible and retain formula image fallbacks as `![Formula](...)` assets when MathML is absent or unusable.
- Normalized final Markdown after asset-link rewrites so downloaded figure / table / formula links replace remote URLs before section parsing, block images are separated from adjacent headings/text/math fences, and empty body parent headings remain visible.
- Hardened structured metadata and references: front matter unescapes HTML entities, Elsevier XML references no longer skip sparse bibliography entries, and Wiley / Springer-style HTML references remove link chrome while preferring visible citation text over DOI-only snippets.
- Tightened Springer / Nature HTML cleanup by pruning more article chrome and license sections, preserving scientific back matter outside the main body, extracting formula image assets, and emitting explicit table-body-unavailable placeholders when table-page parsing fails.
- Adjusted golden-criteria live issue classification so formula-only preview fallback is not treated as an asset-download failure, while non-formula preview fallback still remains an asset issue unless explicitly accepted.

### Docs

- Updated README, provider, FlareSolverr, extraction-rule, deployment, architecture, and schema notes to describe the shared Playwright primary asset path, formula image preservation, Markdown asset-link rewrites, reference fallback behavior, and target-provider `download_tier` semantics.

### Validation

- `pytest tests/unit/test_science_pnas_provider.py tests/unit/test_provider_waterfalls.py tests/unit/test_provider_request_options.py tests/unit/test_html_shared_helpers.py -q`
- `pytest tests/unit/test_elsevier_markdown.py tests/unit/test_golden_criteria_live.py tests/unit/test_models_render.py tests/unit/test_science_pnas_markdown.py tests/unit/test_springer_html_regressions.py -q`
- Live smoke: Wiley `10.1111/gcb.16455` downloaded 5/5 full-size body figures, Science `10.1126/science.ady3136` downloaded 6/6 full-size body figures, and PNAS `10.1073/pnas.2406303121` downloaded 4/4 full-size body figures; all local files had image magic bytes, dimensions, and Markdown links rewritten to local paths.

## 2026-04-19

### Changed

- Moved shared HTML full-text diagnostics into [`src/paper_fetch/providers/_html_availability.py`](src/paper_fetch/providers/_html_availability.py) and switched `html_generic`, `elsevier`, `springer`, FlareSolverr, and PDF fallback helpers to import the shared availability/access-signal layers directly instead of reaching through `_science_pnas_html.py`.
- Added internal `PublisherProfile` plumbing in [`src/paper_fetch/providers/_science_pnas_profiles.py`](src/paper_fetch/providers/_science_pnas_profiles.py) so browser-workflow candidate builders, noise-profile selection, and provider-specific postprocess hooks live outside `_science_pnas_html.py`.
- Removed the `_article_markdown_document.py` compatibility wrapper; direct Elsevier document assembly now lives only in [`src/paper_fetch/providers/_article_markdown_elsevier_document.py`](src/paper_fetch/providers/_article_markdown_elsevier_document.py), while [`src/paper_fetch/providers/_article_markdown.py`](src/paper_fetch/providers/_article_markdown.py) remains the intentional aggregate entrypoint.
- Split the oversized `tests/unit/test_science_pnas_html.py` coverage into focused candidate, availability, markdown, and postprocess test files, while keeping `detect_html_block()` coverage in `tests/unit/test_html_access_signals.py`.
- Promoted the geography report/export/group scripts plus their supporting modules and tests into tracked repo-local internal tooling without adding new CLI install surfaces or MCP tools.

### Docs

- Updated README, provider docs, and backlog notes to describe geography report/export/group as live-only internal tooling behind `PAPER_FETCH_RUN_LIVE=1`.

### Validation

- `pytest tests/unit/test_science_pnas_candidates.py tests/unit/test_html_availability.py tests/unit/test_science_pnas_markdown.py tests/unit/test_science_pnas_postprocess.py tests/unit/test_html_access_signals.py tests/unit/test_elsevier_markdown.py -q`

## 2026-04-16

### Added

- Added a public `provider_status()` MCP tool that reports stable local diagnostics for `crossref`, `elsevier`, `springer`, `wiley`, `science`, and `pnas` without probing remote publisher APIs.
- Added provider-level status probing with stable `ready` / `partial` / `not_configured` / `rate_limited` / `error` semantics plus per-provider `checks=[...]` details.
- Added MCP `resources/list_changed` support for cache resources when `fetch_paper()`, `list_cached()`, or `get_cached()` changes the visible cache-resource URI set for the current session.

### Changed

- Changed all 8 public MCP tools to expose `ToolAnnotations`; read-only tools now advertise `readOnlyHint=true`, while `fetch_paper` stays writable because it may refresh local cache files.
- Changed Science / PNAS local diagnostics so MCP can inspect FlareSolverr runtime readiness and local rate-limit windows without mutating the rate-limit tracking file.
- Changed `batch_resolve()` and `batch_check()` to reject requests with more than `50` queries instead of attempting oversized batch runs.
- Changed MCP initialization so the server now advertises `capabilities.resources.listChanged=true` across supported transports.

### Docs

- Updated README, deployment docs, provider docs, and the bundled skill guide to document `provider_status()` and the new MCP tool-annotation hints.
- Updated README, deployment docs, and the bundled skill guide to document the `50`-query batch limit and the new cache-resource list-change notifications.

## 2026-04-15

### Added

- Added a dedicated `has_fulltext(query)` MCP probe tool with cheap Crossref, provider-metadata, and landing-page HTML-meta signals.
- Added JSON output schemas for all 7 public MCP tools so schema-aware clients can validate tool results and surface stronger autocomplete.
- Added `fetch_paper(..., prefer_cache=true)` cache-first short-circuiting backed by an MCP-local cached FetchEnvelope sidecar.
- Added `missing_env=[...]` on MCP error payloads when missing credentials or required environment variables can be identified.
- Added two MCP prompt templates, `summarize_paper(query, focus)` and `verify_citation_list(citations, mode)`, for cache-first paper summaries and batch-first citation-list triage.
- Added `token_estimate_breakdown={abstract,body,refs}` to `fetch_paper` results, `article.quality`, and `batch_check(mode="article")` item payloads.

### Changed

- Changed `batch_check(mode="metadata")` to reuse the cheap probe path instead of running the full fetch waterfall.
- Changed the bundled skill layout to a thin `SKILL.md` entrypoint plus `references/` docs for environment variables, CLI fallback, and failure handling.
- Changed `batch_resolve` and `batch_check` to accept optional `concurrency`, allowing cross-host overlap while the shared HTTP transport still serializes same-host requests.
- Changed long-running MCP `fetch_paper` and `batch_*` tool calls to observe cancellation cooperatively so cancelled requests stop issuing follow-up network work.
- Changed MCP cache resources so explicit non-default `download_dir` values also register scoped cache-index and cached-entry resources for the current server session.
- Changed MCP `fetch_paper.strategy` to accept optional `inline_image_budget` controls for inline `ImageContent` limits without changing service-layer fetch behavior or cache eligibility.
- Changed `token_estimate` semantics to remain backward compatible as `abstract + body`, while the new `refs` budget now lives only in `token_estimate_breakdown`.
- Changed MCP cached FetchEnvelope sidecar loading to backfill missing token-breakdown fields when reading older cache entries that predate the new contract.

### Docs

- Updated README, deployment docs, the skill guide, and the probe-semantics note to document the shipped `has_fulltext` v1 behavior and the new `batch_check(mode="metadata")` semantics.
- Updated the static skill installer and architecture docs to treat `skills/paper-fetch-skill/` as a runtime-agnostic bundle that can include on-demand `references/` files.
- Updated MCP-facing docs to describe the new `concurrency` parameter and the "cross-host concurrent, same-host serial" behavior of `batch_*`.
- Updated the MCP-facing docs and skill notes to describe cooperative cancellation for `fetch_paper` and `batch_*`.
- Updated README, deployment docs, and MCP instruction text to document scoped cache resources for explicit isolated download directories.
- Updated README, deployment docs, skill notes, and MCP instruction text to document `strategy.inline_image_budget` and its default `3 / 2 MiB / 8 MiB` inline-image caps.
- Updated README, deployment docs, and the bundled skill guide to document the two published MCP prompts and the new `token_estimate_breakdown` budgeting hint.

## 2026-04-14

### Added

- Added public `science` and `pnas` provider routes, including direct `provider_hint`, `preferred_providers`, and final `source` support.
- Added repo-local Science / PNAS provider implementations in [`src/paper_fetch/providers/science.py`](src/paper_fetch/providers/science.py) and [`src/paper_fetch/providers/pnas.py`](src/paper_fetch/providers/pnas.py), backed by shared FlareSolverr, HTML cleanup, and Playwright PDF-fallback helpers.
- Added repo-local `vendor/flaresolverr/` workflow assets, thin wrapper scripts under [`scripts/`](scripts), and a dedicated operator guide in [`docs/flaresolverr.md`](docs/flaresolverr.md).
- Added offline Science / PNAS fixtures plus unit coverage for routing, FlareSolverr error handling, provider fallbacks, and public result provenance.
- Added opt-in live smoke coverage for one Science HTML DOI and one PNAS PDF-fallback DOI behind the existing `PAPER_FETCH_RUN_LIVE=1` gate.

### Changed

- Extended `SourceKind` and the service provider registry so `science` and `pnas` are first-class public provenance values instead of envelope-only aliases.
- Made Science / PNAS use a provider-managed `HTML first -> PDF fallback -> metadata-only fallback` chain, while explicitly skipping the generic `html_generic` fallback after those providers are selected.
- Moved Science / PNAS HTML extraction onto provider-specific cleanup rules, then fed the cleaned HTML back through the existing HTML-to-Markdown pipeline for final rendering.
- Added explicit repo-local runtime checks for `vendor/flaresolverr`, `FLARESOLVERR_ENV_FILE`, local FlareSolverr health, and required local rate-limit settings before Science / PNAS full-text retrieval proceeds.
- Added local Science / PNAS rate-limit accounting in the user data directory and kept `asset_profile=body|all` on those routes as text-only downgrades with warnings instead of hard failures.
- Expanded `install-formula-tools.sh` so repo-local development can bootstrap FlareSolverr source setup, Playwright Chromium, and headless `Xvfb` prerequisites from one entrypoint.

### Docs

- Updated README, deployment guidance, provider docs, MCP instruction snippets, and FlareSolverr workflow docs to describe the new Science / PNAS route, repo-local-only support boundary, required environment variables, and operator-owned ToS risk.

### Validation

- `python3 -m compileall src/paper_fetch`
- `ruff check src/paper_fetch tests/unit`
- `PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m unittest -q tests.unit.test_publisher_identity tests.unit.test_resolve_query tests.unit.test_science_pnas_html tests.unit.test_science_pnas_flaresolverr tests.unit.test_science_pnas_provider tests.unit.test_service`

## 2026-04-13

### Added

- Added MCP cache indexing with `list_cached()` / `get_cached()` plus `resource://paper-fetch/cache-index` and `resource://paper-fetch/cached/{entry_id}` resources for the default shared download directory.
- Added `batch_resolve(queries)` and `batch_check(queries, mode)` MCP tools so citation-list workflows can stay serial, transport-reusing, and context-light.
- Added canonical MCP/skill-facing instruction helpers in [`src/paper_fetch/mcp/_instructions.py`](src/paper_fetch/mcp/_instructions.py) to keep defaults, environment notes, and error-contract wording aligned.
- Added inline `ImageContent` support for a few local body figures when `strategy.asset_profile` is `body` or `all`.
- Added structured MCP progress updates and structured log notifications for `fetch_paper`, `batch_check`, and `batch_resolve`.
- Added live MCP end-to-end smoke coverage for representative Elsevier and HTML-fallback flows.
- Added a probe-semantics design note in [`docs/architecture/probe-semantics.md`](docs/architecture/probe-semantics.md) to define the future `has_fulltext(query)` direction.

### Changed

- Moved public change history and shipped-surface notes out of ad hoc backlog docs into this changelog.
- Exposed `download_dir` on the MCP `fetch_paper` surface so task-local directories can override `PAPER_FETCH_DOWNLOAD_DIR` and XDG defaults.
- Expanded MCP `resolve_paper` to accept either a raw `query` or structured `title` plus optional `authors` / `year`.
- Updated the static skill to document the real defaults, the environment variables that affect behavior, the error contract, cache-first call discipline, and the batch-first bibliography workflow.
- Clarified that `include_refs=null` behaves like `all` for `max_tokens="full_text"` and like `top10` for numeric token budgets.
- Reworked the skill frontmatter into a shorter trigger-style description and moved call-discipline guidance ahead of the main workflow.
- Shifted provider routing toward Crossref/domain-first hints with DOI-prefix fallback only when needed, and added route diagnostics to `source_trail`.
- Unified text-normalization, DOI extraction, metadata merge helpers, and HTML lookup heuristics around shared utilities to reduce duplicate logic.
- Split large renderer and HTML modules into thinner facades backed by focused helpers while preserving public compatibility entrypoints.
- Refined CLI exit codes, Markdown asset-link handling, render budgeting, and token-estimation internals without changing the public fetch contract.

### Fixed

- Protected in-process HTTP GET caching with `threading.RLock`.
- Switched the HTTP transport to `urllib3.PoolManager` for connection reuse without changing the public request contract.
- Added response-size guards, gzip pre-decompression size checks, cache-budget eviction, and safer retry behavior for timeout/transient errors.
- Converted payload and asset writes to atomic `.part -> replace` flows so failed writes do not corrupt final files.
- Tightened exception handling so programming errors are no longer silently downgraded into partial-download or fallback paths.
- Prevented `batch_check()` from writing payloads to disk by forcing `download_dir=None`.
- Preserved top-level fetch provenance fields even when `article`, `markdown`, or `metadata` are unrequested and therefore returned as `null`.

### Docs

- Kept architecture rationale in [`docs/architecture/overview.md`](docs/architecture/overview.md) and moved shipped changes to this file.
- Updated deployment, provider, MCP, and skill-facing documentation to match the landed MCP surface and environment behavior.

### Validation

- `ruff check .`
- `PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m pytest tests/unit tests/integration -q`
- `PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m pytest -n 0 tests/live/test_live_mcp.py -q` skips cleanly when live env is not enabled; `-n 0` is required because live MCP shares external publisher/API state and secrets.

### Follow-up

- The dedicated MCP probe tool `has_fulltext(query)` is intentionally not shipped yet; only its semantics note is landed in [`docs/architecture/probe-semantics.md`](docs/architecture/probe-semantics.md).
